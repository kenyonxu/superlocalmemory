"""The recall marker must reach the wire, or the whole learning loop is dead.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``run_recall`` has always computed ``result.marker`` — an HMAC of the fact id —
on the hot path. Until 4.0.8 **no serialiser ever read it**, so every recall
computed the value and threw it away.

That single omission severed the closed loop end to end:

    recall emits marker  ->  (dropped here)  ->  agent's tool response has no
    marker  ->  post_tool_outcome finds nothing  ->  register_signal never
    called  ->  outcome settles at the formula base 0.5

and the consequences were measurable on a real store: 162 outcomes all at the
default label, all 294 source-quality observations at exactly 0.5, therefore
``alpha == beta`` for all 18 sources ("no quality signal has settled"), and 165
bandit arms with 4 plays between them.

The failure was invisible from every side. Recall worked. The hook was
installed and ran. The reward formula was correct. Nothing logged an error.
Only comparing what recall produced against what crossed the wire showed it.

OPTION B — markers are gated on ``session_id``
----------------------------------------------
A marker costs ~33 characters of the agent's context per result, and it can
only buy a signal when a ``pending_outcomes`` row exists to settle — which
happens only for session-bearing recalls. So markers ride along exactly when
they can be used, and ad-hoc recalls pay nothing.
