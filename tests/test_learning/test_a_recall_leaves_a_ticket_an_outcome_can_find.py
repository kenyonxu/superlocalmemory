"""Nothing can learn from a recall that left no record of itself.

WHAT WAS MEASURED, BEFORE

The queue that carries "these memories were shown, for this query, in this
session" had **no callers anywhere in the source**. A worker started with the
daemon and waited for events that were never sent. Consequences on a real store,
all of them downstream of that one gap:

    pending tickets carrying a join key      0 of 162
    outcomes carrying a join key             0 of 162
    per-memory usefulness scores off 0.5     0 of 377
    ranking model last retrained             eleven weeks earlier

Every hop after the first was working and had nothing to work on.

WHAT THIS MUST NOT COST

Recall is read-path work under a two-second budget, and a user notices latency
long before they notice that ranking has stopped improving. So the ticket is one
``put_nowait`` on a bounded in-memory queue: measured at **1.57 microseconds**,
0.0001% of a 1,449 ms recall. It drops rather than blocks when full and never
raises.

``test_the_enqueue_is_cheap_enough_to_ignore`` below re-measures that cost on
whatever machine runs it and holds it under 100 microseconds; 1.57 is what this
machine returned, not a threshold anything enforces.

The other figure here has no harness and cannot get one: an A/B over 30 warmed
queries against a 640 MB copy of the author's store moved p50 by −3.5 ms with the
change ON, which is to say it moved by nothing. Reproducing it needs that store,
a loaded model and a warm page cache, so it was **measured by hand and is not
reproducible from this repository**. Treat it as the author's observation rather
than as a guarantee this suite checks.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO

It records; it does not act. Whether learning may reorder results stays a
separate explicit setting, still off by default, so wiring this changes what the
system knows and not what it returns.
