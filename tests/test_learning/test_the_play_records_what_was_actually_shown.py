"""A play's evidence has to describe the answer the user saw.

A play is settled later by asking whether anything downstream referenced one of
the memories this query surfaced. That question is answered against a stored
list of fact ids — so if the list describes a different answer than the one
returned, an outcome citing a memory the user actually saw settles nothing, and
the arm never learns from it.

The list was written by the ranking pass. The continuity bias runs after that
pass and can lift a memory into the answer, so the two disagreed exactly when
continuity did something — which is the case the bias exists for.
