"""An answer carries a name, and a report about it can quote that name.

Closing the loop needs three things that were each missing. A recall had to
leave a record — it did not, on 34 of the 35 paths that call it, because the
record is discarded when the caller cannot name a session and almost no caller
could. The record had to be findable — the column meant to find it by was never
written. And a client had to be able to quote the name — the answer never
contained one, so nothing could.

With all three, a report joins to the exact recall it is about. Without them,
the best available link is which memories happen to overlap, inside a window.

    a matching id and no signal was ever registered against one. Accepting it
    produced a row that could never be
    matched, which the proxy settler then defaulted to a neutral 0.5 — and a
    neutral update tightens a Beta posterior around its prior rather than
    leaving it free to move.
