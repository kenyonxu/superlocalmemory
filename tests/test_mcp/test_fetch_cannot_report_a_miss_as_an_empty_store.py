"""``fetch`` is how an agent verifies a write. It must not lie about one.

GitHub #135. ``fetch(fact_ids: str)`` split on commas and returned whatever
matched. A token that matched nothing produced::

    {"success": true, "results": [], "count": 0}

which is byte-identical to a correct answer for a fact that does not exist. The
caller cannot tell "my call was malformed" from "the store lost my data", so
the reasonable next step is to start debugging the store. That is what the
reporter did, and it cost hours.

MEASURED, because the original diagnosis had this backwards. Against the real
SDK (mcp 2.0.0 / pydantic 2.13.4) the server does NOT stringify a list -- it
rejects it::

    fetch(fact_ids=["abc123"])    -> ValidationError: Input should be a valid string
    fetch(fact_ids='["abc123"]')  -> {"success": true, "results": [], "count": 0}

So the ``"['abc123']"`` the reporter saw was produced by their CLIENT, before
the call. Accepting ``list[str]`` therefore does NOT fix the reported symptom
on its own -- that client still sends a string. The honest error is the
load-bearing fix; list acceptance is ergonomics. Both are here, and the parser
also understands the two stringified-array shapes a client can produce, because
that is the shape that actually reached the store.
