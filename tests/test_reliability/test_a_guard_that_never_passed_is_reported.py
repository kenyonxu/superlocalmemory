"""A feature gated on schema that is absent must be reported as never having run.

Falling back when a column is missing is correct behaviour -- it is what keeps an
old store openable. The problem is that it is indistinguishable from working:
nothing raises, static analysis passes, a call-graph trace reaches the code, and
coverage counts the line. Only asking the store answers the question.

The verdict that matters most is ``SATISFIED_ELSEWHERE``. The common case is not
that the data is missing; it is that the guard asks the wrong table. Reporting
where the data actually lives turns a dead feature into a one-line fix with no
migration, and that is the difference between a diagnostic and a bug report.
