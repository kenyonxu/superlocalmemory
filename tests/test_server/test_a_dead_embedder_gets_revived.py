"""The monitor that revives a dead embedder has to notice it is dead.

WHAT WAS OBSERVED

A daemon killed its embedding worker on the routine idle timeout — by design,
every 45-60 minutes — and never respawned it. For over an hour, across two
restarts, the recall-health monitor wrote **nothing at all**: no tick line, no
warning, not one CRITICAL. `readiness.embedding` stayed false and the daemon sat
in `warming` forever. A manual restart fixed it every time, which is what made it
look like the monitor thread had died or never started.

The thread was fine. It was ticking on schedule and concluding, every time, that
everything was healthy.

WHY

Tier 2 asked one question: are there results whose semantic score is all zero?
Zero results was explicitly excluded from that signature, on the reasoning that
an empty corpus should not be read as a broken embedder. But **a dead embedder is
one of the reasons a recall returns nothing** — the semantic channel contributes
zero candidates, and the probe phrase appears verbatim in nobody's memories, so
keyword finds nothing either. So the one symptom that should have triggered the
heal was taken as proof that no heal was needed. And because a healthy verdict is
silent by design, it left no trace.

WHAT CHANGED

The embedder is now asked directly whether it can produce a vector, which is a
question a recall cannot answer. And the fact of a tick is recorded, so a quiet
monitor can be told apart from an absent one without reading the log.
