"""The lists that answer "what is in my memory", checked by asking them.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, WHICH IS THE POINT OF IT
----------------------------------------------
4.0.10 moved model-authored summaries out of the retrieval corpus, excluded
them from every ``DatabaseManager`` read path and every retrieval channel, and
enumerated those paths in a test. That enumeration was of *methods*. Two HTTP
routes never call one — they build their own SQL against ``atomic_facts`` — so
neither was covered, and both shipped still serving withheld rows.

Measured against a live store on released 4.0.10:

    GET /api/memories?limit=50      24 of 50 rows withheld, page ONE
                                    total reported 5,218 · real memories 3,919
    GET /api/v3/timeline/?range=30d  2 of 200 events withheld

The first is the dashboard's main memory list. The release note for 4.0.10 was
"your memories, not the summarizer's", and that list was showing the
summarizer's, above the fold, with the count inflated by exactly the 1,299 rows
the release had withheld.

WHY THIS TEST CALLS THE SURFACE INSTEAD OF GREPPING IT. The obvious cheap guard
is to assert that no module selects from ``atomic_facts`` without the clause.
That guard would have been useless here and actively misleading: 68 files run
unguarded SQL against that table and almost all of them are *supposed* to —
migrations, GDPR erasure, lifecycle sweeps, the repair itself. Meanwhile
``mcp/tools_active.py`` selects from it directly and was already clean. Presence
of raw SQL predicts nothing. What a reader cares about is what arrived on their
screen, so that is what is asserted: seed a withheld row, call the route, look
at the response.

If you add a surface that lists or counts memories, add it here.
