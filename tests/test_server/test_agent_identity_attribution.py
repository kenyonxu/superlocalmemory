"""Multi-Agent Memory must group by agent identity, not by capability digest.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The pane exists to tell agents apart. It grouped by
``ingestion_operations.trusted_actor_id`` — the capability that authorised the
write — which on a real store is a digest. The result was 43 rows of
``daemon-capability:923b7d6e616f46d3739315580e13fa97...`` and not one readable
name, in the one view whose whole job is attribution.

Worse than unreadable: it was *wrong*. A single agent writes under many
capabilities over time, so one writer fragmented into many rows —
``claude-desktop`` alone spanned 18 capabilities and appeared as 18 "agents".
Grouped by identity it is one agent with 215 memories.

The names were never missing. Writers pass ``agent_id`` and it is stored in
``raw_metadata_json``; the query simply never looked there. On the author's
store that yields claude-desktop, claude, gemini, codex, grok and mcp_client —
exactly the multi-framework picture (CrewAI / LangChain / LangGraph) the pane
advertises.
