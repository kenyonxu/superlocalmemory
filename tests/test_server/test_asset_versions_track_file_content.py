"""An asset's version string must move when the asset does.

``index.html`` referenced 64 static assets. 35 carried a hand-written ``?v=``
and 29 carried nothing, and none was derived from the file it pointed at. During
4.0.10 a change to ``od-memories.js`` shipped with its literal still reading the
previous value, which is the failure mode: the number looks like cache-busting,
nothing checks it, and the next person assumes it is handled.

WHAT THIS IS NOT PROTECTING AGAINST, so nobody widens it on a false premise.
Three mechanisms already stop a stale asset reaching a browser here, and the
first was checked against the running daemon rather than assumed:

  * ``/static/*`` is served ``Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`` with an
    ETag, so a browser must revalidate rather than serve its cached copy.
  * The unified daemon re-copies the UI tree into the data directory on every
    start, so an upgrade refreshes what it serves.
  * ``index.html`` is itself ``no-cache``.

What these tests protect is the ability to CHANGE that: the revalidation policy
costs a conditional request per asset per page load, 64 of them, and the obvious
fix is a long ``max-age``. That is only safe once versions track content. So the
value here is a policy change becoming possible, plus 64 hand-maintained numbers
becoming zero.
