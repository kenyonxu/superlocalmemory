"""Storing a fact twice under one id must not delete the rows hanging off it.

``store_fact`` used ``INSERT OR REPLACE``, which SQLite implements as a DELETE
followed by an INSERT. Eight tables carry
``FOREIGN KEY (fact_id) REFERENCES atomic_facts (fact_id) ON DELETE CASCADE``,
so re-storing a fact under an id that already existed dropped its retention
row, its access history, its context and its importance — returned the fact_id
as though it had succeeded, and raised nothing.

This is the same defect already fixed in ``store_memory``. It was left in place
here because no caller had been *shown* to reach it: ``store_fact`` dedups on
content and returns early, and ``fact_id`` normally comes from a uuid factory.

A caller does reach it. ``MemoryEngine.store_fact_direct`` exists to persist a
caller-chosen id — ``canonical_store_fact`` is documented as ingesting "a
caller-built fact without changing its public ID" and raises if the id is not
preserved. Within one profile an idempotency key of ``prebuilt:<fact_id>``
catches a second store of different content. But that key is scoped
``(profile_id, source_type, idempotency_key)`` while ``atomic_facts.fact_id``
is a bare ``TEXT PRIMARY KEY`` — global. So the same id stored from a second
profile misses the idempotency guard, then misses the content dedup (which
filters on ``profile_id`` too), and lands on the replace.

``test_a_second_profile_cannot_destroy_the_first_profiles_fact`` pins that
path; it fails on the unfixed code with the first profile's fact gone.
