"""A defective store has to fix itself, because most owners will not fix it.

About three quarters of this product's users are not engineers. The repair for
a poisoned store therefore cannot be a runbook, a repository clone or a SQL
snippet -- it has to happen on the next start, on pip, npm and source installs
alike, with nobody asked to do anything.

M043 is that repair. These tests pin the three things it must never get wrong:

  * it must PRESERVE before it WITHHOLDS, so a summary the owner can see today
    is still visible tomorrow;
  * its predicates must be exact, so no genuine memory is swept up;
  * it must be safe to run on every start forever, which means idempotent and
    self-limiting.

Plus the enforcement half: a withheld row must be unreachable through every
channel, not merely marked.
