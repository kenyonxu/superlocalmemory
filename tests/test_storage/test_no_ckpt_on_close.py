"""Regression tests for the WAL close-path deadlock fix (NO_CKPT_ON_CLOSE).

Root cause (production incident + in-suite reproduction, 2026-08-13):
closing a WAL-mode connection triggers a checkpoint inside sqlite3WalClose.
That checkpoint can wait indefinitely on reader marks pinned by another
connection — while the close path holds SQLite's process-global VFS mutex,
so every later sqlite3.connect() in the process convoys behind it.
PRAGMA busy_timeout does NOT apply to the close path.

Fix: every per-call connection opened by DatabaseManager._connect() sets
SQLITE_DBCONFIG_NO_CKPT_ON_CLOSE, so close() never checkpoints and cannot
block. Routine checkpointing continues via PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint=400.
