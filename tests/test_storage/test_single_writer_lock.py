"""TDD — single-writer lock across all memory.db writers.

GATE BLOCKER
============
Before v3.8.4, DatabaseManager, VectorStore, adapter_base.sync_log_record,
and several learning modules each opened their own sqlite3.connect() to
memory.db WITHOUT holding a shared Python lock.  Under WAL mode only ONE
writer can hold the write lock at any instant; concurrent Python threads
competing for it produce SQLITE_BUSY errors that trigger
DatabaseManager._execute_one's 5x 10-second retry loop — up to 50-second
stalls on user /remember calls.

Fix: write_lock.get_write_lock(db_path) returns a per-path process-level
RLock.  Every in-process writer acquires this lock BEFORE opening sqlite3.
DatabaseManager._lock IS this same lock (via get_write_lock in __init__).

TDD Contract
============
RED  (tree 2f35ddc — no shared write lock):
  * test_db_manager_lock_identity          FAILS (new RLock per DM instance,
                                            not equal to get_write_lock result)
  * test_vector_store_waits_for_write_lock FAILS (vs.upsert() opens conn
                                            instantly, doesn't wait for lock)
                                            [skipped if sqlite-vec unavailable]
  * test_adapter_sync_waits_for_write_lock FAILS (sync_log_record opens conn
                                            without acquiring write lock)

GREEN (after fix):
  * All three PASS — shared lock object, and writers serialised.
  * test_realistic_concurrent_writes PASSES — zero "database is locked"
    errors under real concurrent load, user store completes in < 2 s.
