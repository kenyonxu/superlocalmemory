"""The dashboard must never be able to block recall or remember.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The dashboard reads memory.db directly, and it reads a lot: panes poll, users
refresh, and several cards each issue their own query. Recall and remember run
from the CLI, the desktop app and MCP against the SAME file. If a dashboard read
could take a lock, a refreshing browser tab would slow down every agent on the
machine — and the symptom would appear as "SLM got slow", nowhere near the
dashboard.

Four independent properties make that impossible, and each is asserted here
rather than trusted:

1. **``mode=ro``** — the connection is opened read-only at the URI level, so
   SQLite physically refuses to grant it a write lock. Not a convention: an
   attempted write raises.
2. **``PRAGMA query_only=ON``** — a second, independent barrier, so a future
   refactor that loses the URI flag still cannot write.
3. **WAL journal mode** — readers never block the writer and the writer never
   blocks readers. Without WAL, properties 1 and 2 would still leave a reader
   holding a shared lock that stalls a commit.
4. **A capped ``busy_timeout``** — a dashboard read waits milliseconds, not
   seconds, so even a pathological case degrades the dashboard rather than the
   agent.

These are cheap assertions guarding an expensive, hard-to-diagnose failure.
