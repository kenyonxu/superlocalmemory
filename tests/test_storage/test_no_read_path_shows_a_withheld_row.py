"""Every way of reading a memory, checked against one rule.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, WHICH IS THE POINT OF IT
----------------------------------------------
4.0.10 first put the withheld-row filter in ``get_facts_by_ids`` alone. The
reasoning was that every retrieval channel re-authorises its candidates through
that method and the engine drops anything it cannot hydrate, so one clause there
covers the lot. That reasoning was correct. The conclusion was wrong: it covered
the RECALL pipeline, and ``search``, ``list_recent``, ``fetch``, ``export``, the
pinned-context injection and the dashboard's own search box are not the recall
pipeline. They read the table directly.

Two independent audits found it immediately. Measured on a copy of the author's
real store, before the fix:

    search_facts_fts("information available")   50 returned, 20 withheld
    get_all_facts(limit=400)                   400 returned, 66 withheld
    get_fact_count()                           5,093 — inflated by 1,195

So "one place" was the right instinct expressed as the wrong mechanism. There is
no single SQL choke point available here: ``_scope_where`` is the only universal
predicate and it is spliced against ``graph_edges``, ``temporal_events``,
``memories``, ``bm25_tokens``, ``fact_temporal_validity`` and
``correction_cases`` as well as ``atomic_facts``, so it cannot carry a fact
column. The honest form is one CLAUSE plus an enumerated set of call sites --
and an enumeration is only trustworthy if something checks it. That is this
file's whole job.

If you add a read path, add it here. If a test below fails, a caller is showing
the owner a model's non-answer as though it were their own note.
