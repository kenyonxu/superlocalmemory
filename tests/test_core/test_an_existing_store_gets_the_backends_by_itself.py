"""Shipping a dependency is not the same as using it.

Cozo and LanceDB have been required dependencies since 3.7 and the projections
that make them serve were built only by three manual commands. Almost nobody
ran them, so almost every store kept answering graph and similarity questions
out of SQLite while carrying two unused libraries.

What matters in the automatic version is what it refuses to do: it must never
leave a store worse than it found it, and it must never stop one from working.
A user whose native extension does not match their interpreter would otherwise
have no product at all — and that was the state of the machine this was written
on.
