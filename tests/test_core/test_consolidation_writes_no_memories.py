"""A summary is a view of memory. It must not become a memory.

v3.6 introduced consolidated summaries to show a non-technical reader what
their store contains, deliberately kept out of the retrieval corpus. v3.6.4
then ended each cluster with a raw ``INSERT INTO atomic_facts`` and the
boundary was gone -- silently, because nothing asserted it.

What that cost, measured on the author's 5,089-fact store before this change:

    consolidator-authored rows in atomic_facts       1,195
      ...retrieval-eligible                            307
      ...that are summaries of summaries               353
      ...with a temporal_events row                      0
    genuine memories archived to make room for them     528
      ...archived by anything other than consolidation    0

and, asked "what am I working on", ranks 1, 2 and 3 all read "Unfortunately,
there is no information available about 'Gateway', 'State', 'Bounded', or
'Claude' in the provided text."

These tests pin the boundary in four independent ways, so restoring any one
piece of the old behaviour fails at least one of them.
