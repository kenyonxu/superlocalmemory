"""A fact is reported findable by meaning only when it actually is.

Two representations are involved and they answer different questions. The vector
projection is what a search on meaning queries, so it alone decides whether a
fact can be *found*. The canonical ``atomic_facts.embedding`` column is where the
vector *lives* — what an export, a backup or a direct fetch reads.

The rules that follow from that, and each one here is a defect that shipped:

* The projection is attempted first, because that ordering keeps the two
  consistent whenever both can succeed.
* The column is written either way. The vector is real data that has already been
  computed, and every reason a projection refuses — no search extension on this
  platform, a store at a different dimension — is a property of the installation
  rather than of one fact, so withholding one fact's column repairs nothing and
  discards the vector.
* Whether a fact is "findable by meaning" is read off the projection, never off
  the column, and never claimed when the projection did not accept the vector.
  That claim, not the column, is what misleads a caller into believing a memory
  is retrievable when no search can reach it.
* If the projection succeeded and the column write then failed, the projection is
  rolled back, so a search cannot return a fact whose vector nothing else holds.
