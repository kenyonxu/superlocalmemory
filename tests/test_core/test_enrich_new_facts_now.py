"""A memory should be findable by meaning as soon as it is stored.

Storing a memory and being able to find it again are different things. A fact
with no vector can only be matched on its own wording, which is not how anyone
asks a question — "what am I working on" shares no distinctive word with any
particular memory. Until the vector exists, the memory describing what is
happening right now is the hardest one in the store to find.

Every entry point — the command line, the tool interface and the dashboard —
commits through one durable receipt and then relies on a background pass to
attach the vector. These tests cover the bounded attempt made before that
receipt is returned, so the window is closed for all three at once rather than
for whichever door happened to be used.

The durable write has already happened by then. Nothing here can fail it: on any
error, any timeout, or a cold embedder, the fact simply keeps its place in the
background queue.
