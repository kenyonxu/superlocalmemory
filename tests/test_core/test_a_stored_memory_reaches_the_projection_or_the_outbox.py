"""A memory that reached SQLite must reach the graph and vector stores too.

The graph and the embeddings live in CozoDB and LanceDB, which are separate
storage engines from SQLite. No transaction can span them, so "write the fact,
then write the projection" has a window: a crash between the two leaves a
memory that exists and cannot be recalled, with nothing recording that it
happened.

The outbox closes that window. A row naming the fact is written *inside the
same SQLite transaction as the fact*, so the two commit or roll back together.
A worker drains the row into the projections and deletes it only once they have
accepted it. Crash anywhere and the row survives, so the work is retried.

These tests pin the invariant the whole design exists for: **every fact in
SQLite is in the projection or in the outbox, and never in neither.**
