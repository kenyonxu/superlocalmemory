"""Steps 8-11 of consolidation must run, and must not fail silently.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Behavioural assertion mining, soft prompts, skill performance and skill
evolution are steps 8-11 of ``ConsolidationEngine.consolidate(lightweight=False)``.
Before 4.0.8 none of them had ever executed on a real install:

* **No trigger took that path.** The engine self-triggers with
  ``lightweight=True``; the session-end hook shelled out to
  ``slm consolidate --cognitive``, which runs ``CognitiveConsolidator`` — a
  different class with no steps 8-11.
* **When it finally ran, two steps crashed**, and both crashes were caught and
  logged at ``debug`` so nothing surfaced:
  - step 9 passed a ``DatabaseManager`` to ``CrossProjectAggregator`` and
    ``WorkflowMiner``, which take a path → ``Path(db)`` raised TypeError.
  - step 11 built ``EvolutionBudget`` against memory.db, but
    ``evolution_llm_cost_log`` is created by M010 in learning.db →
    "no such table".

The measurable symptom was a Brain pane full of zeros that looked like an empty
store but was an unrun pipeline. These tests pin the wiring, because every one
of these failures was invisible by construction.

    These tests assert on what the function *does*, and the functions in
