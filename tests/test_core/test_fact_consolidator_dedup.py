"""Re-consolidating an unchanged cluster must converge, not accumulate.

HISTORY, because it explains the shape of this file. Before v3.6.4 the
consolidator wrote its summary into ``atomic_facts`` with a raw INSERT that
bypassed dedup, so an equivalent cluster spawned a duplicate summary fact on
every pass. v3.6.4 fixed the duplication by adding a reinforce-or-insert dance
against ``atomic_facts`` — and left the summary in the retrieval corpus, which
was the larger mistake and cost 1,195 model-written rows before anyone noticed.

4.0.10 removes the corpus write entirely. The idempotency requirement these
tests were written to protect is unchanged and still worth protecting; only its
target moved, to ``consolidated_summaries`` and its
``UNIQUE (profile_id, entity_id, content)`` constraint.

Deterministic extractive summarisation throughout (mode 'a', config=None — no
LLM), so a second pass over an unchanged cluster produces byte-identical text
and the constraint is actually exercised.
