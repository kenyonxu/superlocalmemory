"""Forgetting is measured on the store's clock, not a working-memory clock.

``EbbinghausCurve`` models working memory: ``max_strength`` is 100, about four
days. The decay cycle fed it real elapsed time from a persistent store, so
anything older than a few days computed ``R ~ 0`` and was filed ``forgotten``.

MEASURED on a real store: **5,546 of 5,561 memories in `forgotten`**, which the
mirror reported as 93.6% archived — and every subsystem that reads only active
memories saw almost nothing.

4.1.15 rescaled the SEED path and left the DECAY path alone, so the decay cycle
overwrote every corrected tier minutes later. The conversion now lives in ONE
place, ``EbbinghausCurve.store_scaled_strength``, which both call — the two
cannot drift apart again.
