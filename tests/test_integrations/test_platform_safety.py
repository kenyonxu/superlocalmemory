"""Platform safety tests for the bounded-loops MCP bridge.

Verifies that the bridge's executable trust checks behave correctly under
simulated Windows conditions.

Windows trust-check behaviour (documented limitation):
    On Windows, only the S_ISREG check applies.  The group/other-writable
    mode-bit check and the uid/ownership check are both skipped because:
      - Python's os.stat() on Windows returns emulated Unix mode bits that
        do not accurately reflect real ACL permissions; the check would be
        meaningless.
      - os.geteuid() does not exist on Windows; referencing it raises
        AttributeError.  Additionally, st_uid is always 0 on Windows, so
        the uid check could never identify a non-root owner anyway.

    Proper Windows ownership verification requires Win32 ACL APIs (advapi32)
    or the optional pywin32 package.  That is scoped for a future release.
    This file documents the current contract and ensures no regression causes
    the code to crash with AttributeError on the Windows code path.
