"""Project summaries must be reachable and must not overstate their coverage.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two defects shipped together in 4.0.8's Summaries tab.

**Unreachable.** The pane offered a "This project" button that sent an empty
target, and the endpoint answers an empty project target with HTTP 400
"project requires target". It could never have worked: SLM runs as one global
daemon and the dashboard is a browser tab, so there is no working directory for
"this" to mean. The fix is a picker fed by projects the store has actually
observed, which is what ``/api/summary/projects`` exists to serve.

**Overstated.** Coverage was ``FULL`` when *either* tool events or facts were
present. A project with 86 tool events and no stored facts therefore rendered as
"Built from 0 memories · coverage: full" — a claim of complete coverage over
nothing. Project logs describe two things, what was done and what was learned;
"full" now requires both.
