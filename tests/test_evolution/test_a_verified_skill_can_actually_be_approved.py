"""A mutation that passes verification used to have nowhere to go.

Automatic approval is off by default and stays off — this rewrites the
instructions an AI follows, and doing that without a person agreeing is not a
default worth shipping. But there was no way for a person to agree either, so
every verified improvement stopped in a quarantine directory and stayed there.

These cover the path that was missing, and the refusals that keep it safe.
