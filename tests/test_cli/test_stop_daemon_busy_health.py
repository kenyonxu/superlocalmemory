"""Regression tests for the "Daemon was not running" false report (v4.1.4).

The bug, confirmed live against the real running daemon on this machine
(pid, ``daemon.pid``, and ``lsof -i :8765`` all agreed the process was up and
listening the whole time):

  ``slm serve stop`` and Step 1 of ``slm restart`` intermittently reported the
  daemon as not running while ``ps``/``lsof`` proved it was alive and
  listening. A raw ``kill -TERM <pid>`` always worked within ~5s, which rules
  out a wedged process or an ignored signal — the bug was in the CLI's own
  "is a daemon running, and can I stop it" detection, not in the daemon.

Root cause: ``/maintenance/run`` and ``/consolidate/cognitive`` run
multi-second (sometimes multi-minute) synchronous work directly inline in
their ``async def`` handlers, with no ``asyncio.to_thread``/executor offload
— unlike ``/recall`` (fixed for exactly this class of bug in v3.4.52, per its
own inline comment) and unlike the periodic full-consolidation timer loop
(``server/consolidation_runner.py``, which does use ``asyncio.to_thread``).
FastAPI/uvicorn runs a single-threaded event loop by default, so while one of
those two handlers is running, *no* request on that loop can be serviced,
``GET /health`` included.

``daemon.py``'s ``_fetch_health()`` makes exactly one HTTP attempt with a 2s
timeout and no retry, and both ``is_daemon_running()`` and
``daemon_request()`` (which ``stop_daemon()`` used unconditionally before
this fix) treated that single timeout as proof the daemon was down — even
though ``_resolve_descriptor_liveness()`` (PID + clock-independent start
token, no HTTP involved) had *already*, independently, proven the recorded
process was alive on that call path. Reproduced live: while a genuine
``POST /maintenance/run`` call was in flight against the production daemon,
15 out of 15 health polls from a separate process timed out at exactly the
2.00s cap, and ``is_daemon_running()`` returned False for the entire busy
window, while ``ps``/``lsof`` never stopped showing the process listening.

The fix, exercised below:
  - ``daemon_request(..., verify_health=False)`` — new opt-in that skips the
    ``GET /health`` identity preflight. The daemon still authenticates the
    request by its capability header on arrival (``_require_daemon_actor``),
    so this drops a redundant, stall-prone round trip, not a security check.
  - ``stop_daemon()`` now checks ``_descriptor_process_is_alive(descriptor)``
    directly (the same cheap, non-HTTP proof ``is_daemon_running()`` already
    computes) and, once that is proven, sends ``POST /stop`` with
    ``verify_health=False`` instead of letting a stalled health preflight
    veto a stop request to a process it has already proven it owns.
  - ``owned_daemon_process_alive()`` — a new, HTTP-free liveness check for
    "is there a process I need to stop," used by ``cmd_restart``'s Step 1
    instead of ``is_daemon_running()`` (which answers a different question:
    "is it healthy enough to serve"). Before this fix, a busy-but-alive
    daemon made Step 1 skip the stop entirely ("already stopped"), then Step
    3 refused to start a second daemon on the still-occupied port and the
    whole restart failed.
