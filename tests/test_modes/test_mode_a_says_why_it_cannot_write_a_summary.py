"""A mode with no model must say so, not just quietly do less.

Mode A runs with no language model at all — that is the point of it, and it is
why nothing on the store or recall path reaches the network. A summary in Mode A
is assembled from the user's own notes rather than written.

The surfaces already said *what* they did. None said *why*, or what to do about
it. Someone seeing a plainer summary than they expected had no way to learn that
a written one needs a model and which modes have one, and would reasonably
conclude the feature was broken.

These tests pin the explanation: present when there is no model, absent when
there is, and identical wherever it appears.
