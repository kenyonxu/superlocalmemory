"""Upgrading the package does not upgrade the skills, and that has to be said.

The skills, agents and commands live in the editor's plugin channel — the
``plugin/`` tree, distributed through the editor's own marketplace — not in the
Python distribution. Confirmed against the built wheel: it contains **zero**
files from ``plugin/``, ``codex-plugin/`` or ``copilot-plugin/``.

So ``pip install --upgrade superlocalmemory`` moves the package and leaves every
skill exactly where it was. 4.1 changed 76 files and 862 lines across those
trees. A user who upgraded, read a clean ``slm doctor``, and reasonably concluded
they had the whole release, had no way to discover otherwise — the word "plugin"
appeared nowhere in the output.

This does not change how they are distributed. It makes the gap visible.
