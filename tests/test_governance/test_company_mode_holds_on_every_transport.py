"""Turning on per-user access must mean the same thing however the write arrives.

THE DEFECT

"Company mode" was two independent settings that had never been joined up: a
``deployment`` value in a config file, which the admission gate read, and a
``require_login`` policy in the workspace's own settings, which the dashboard
toggle writes and which the HTTP routes read. Turning company mode on from the
dashboard therefore changed what HTTP allowed and changed nothing anywhere else.

Measured on a copy of a real store, with the policy on, two users configured,
and the viewer's role granting READ only: a write over the agent transport
resolved to ``local-operator`` holding role ``owner`` and succeeded, while the
identical write over HTTP returned 401. Nothing was missing a role check. The
role check ran, against an actor built on the belief that the workspace was
still single-user.

So these tests are about one property: **either switch means a login is
required, on every transport**, and an unidentified caller fails closed.
