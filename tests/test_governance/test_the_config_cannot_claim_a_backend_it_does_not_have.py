"""What the settings say is active must match what is on disk.

THE STATE THIS REPAIRS

On a real store the settings read ``graph_backend='cozo'``,
``vector_backend='lancedb'``, ``scale_engine_state='verified'`` -- and neither
the ``cozo/`` nor the ``lance/`` directory existed, with no promotion journal to
explain it. Something had written the selection a completed promotion writes,
without a promotion having completed.

Nothing corrected it, and nothing would have. The startup recovery acts only
when a promotion journal exists, so with no journal it returns immediately and
the claim survives every restart. The dashboard then reports the configured
backend while retrieval reads SQLite — a disagreement between two surfaces that
a person notices last and trusts first.

The repair is narrow on purpose: remove the claim, disable nothing. ``auto``
still detects and initialises both projections when their libraries are present.
