"""The number in a sentence is a promise, and prose goes stale more quietly
than code.

A sibling test compares the count claimed in the packaging JSON against the
profile it names. It reads three JSON files, so every claim written in
markdown drifted unchecked: the README announced a 16-tool surface for a
plugin that registers 34, and the rules file shipped to the agent announced 16
tools above a table listing 14, for a profile holding 18.

This reads the markdown a user reads, and the table an agent reads.
