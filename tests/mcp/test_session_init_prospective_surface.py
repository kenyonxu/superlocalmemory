"""session_init upcoming-events surface — tests for the scheduled-fact window.

Three tests with distinct failure conditions:

1. A store with a temporal fact dated tomorrow returns that fact in
   ``upcoming_events`` — the window query runs and is wired into the response.

2. A store with zero temporal facts in the 14-day window: the prospective query
   IS executed (proving the code path ran), AND upcoming_events is absent in
   the response — no empty stub.

3. When the DB's execute() raises, the surface degrades silently and
   session_init still returns success=True. The query must have been attempted
   (proven by the spy counter), distinguishing this case from "code never ran".

All three tests FAIL before the implementation and PASS after.
    - Test 1 fails because the key is absent.
    - Tests 2 and 3 fail because the DB execute call counter stays at zero
      (the code that calls execute doesn't exist yet).

Run:
    pytest tests/mcp/test_session_init_prospective_surface.py -v
