"""Tests for HopfieldConfig.prefilter_candidates default and routing behaviour.

Establishes two properties:
  1. The default pool size is 150 (not 1000), so Hopfield stays within the
     1-second latency budget on typical stores.
  2. Shrinking the pool to 150 does not change the returned fact set for a
     query whose answer ranks within the top-150 by cosine similarity —
     the no-quality-trade-off contract.

Test IDs starting at 100 to avoid collision with existing test_hopfield_channel.py
numbering.

        candidates and at least one assertion below must fail — the test would
