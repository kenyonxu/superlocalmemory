"""
Tests for the query-type-conditioned recency amplifier in RetrievalEngine._build_results.

The amplifier multiplies the existing boosted_score by a factor that depends on:
  - query type: "recency" or "temporal" — other types receive exactly 1.0 (no change)
  - fact age: exponential decay from a type-specific maximum amplitude
  - recency_prior_strength: amplitude scalar in RetrievalConfig (0.0 = no effect)

Tests 1 and 4 are RED before the implementation is in place and GREEN after.
Tests 2 and 3 are invariant (pass both ways) and exist to prevent regressions
on factual queries and on the strength=0.0 identity guarantee.
