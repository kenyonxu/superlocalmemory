"""Ordering must be total: equal scores break on fact_id, not on array position.

Two independent findings in the numpy retrieval paths:

  ann_index.py  — argpartition + argsort are score-only.  When N facts share
                  a cosine score, which ones occupy the top-k depends on the
                  memory layout of the underlying array, which is determined
                  by insertion order.  The same query over the same store
                  returns a different candidate set after a restart that
                  reloads facts in a different order.

  hopfield_channel.py — argsort(-similarities) is also score-only.  Identical
                  Hopfield similarity scores (e.g. duplicate fact vectors) are
                  ordered by their position in the memory matrix, which tracks
                  the order facts were loaded from the DB.  That order varies
                  across snapshots, sessions, and DB cursor implementations.

Both files require lexsort((fact_ids, -scores)) so that ties are broken by
the fact_id string — a stable key that is independent of storage layout.
