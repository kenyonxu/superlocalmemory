"""The time-aware channel must be told what kind of question it is answering.

The channel can only fall back to recency when it knows the question is about
the present. That knowledge is produced by the query classifier and has to
survive the trip through the engine's parallel channel dispatch to arrive at
the channel itself.

Both halves of that path are covered elsewhere: the classifier's output is
tested against a table of queries, and the channel's fallback is tested by
calling it directly with an explicit argument. Neither test would notice if
the engine dropped the argument in between, leaving the fallback permanently
unreachable in a running system while every unit test still passed.
