"""A busy machine must not change the answer.

The channel phase runs five producers in parallel and waits once for all of
them. Whatever has not finished by then is cancelled and contributes NOTHING to
fusion -- its candidates are absent, not merely late. So the wait is the one
place in recall where the answer depends on what else the machine happened to
be doing.

Six runs of identical code against the same store logged 0, 0, 25, 2, 0 and 0
abandoned channels: in the third, `hopfield` was cut off on 13 of 140 queries
and `temporal` on 9, while the first lost nothing on those same queries. No
test covered this, which is how the suite stayed green at 9,740 passed while
recall was returning different answers to the same question.

The wait therefore has to be a guard against a wedged channel, not a latency
trim, and when it does bind the caller has to be told the answer is
incomplete. These tests pin both, and pin the ordering that justifies the
value: HARD-RULES RULE 6 puts Complete and Repeatable above Fast.
