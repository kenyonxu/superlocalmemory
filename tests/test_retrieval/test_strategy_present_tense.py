"""Tests for present-tense and recency query classification in strategy.py.

Covers:
  - Present-tense words (now, today, yesterday, currently) classify
    as temporal or recency — not factual.
  - Present-activity phrases ("working on", "at the moment", etc.) classify
    as recency, not factual.
  - Plainly factual queries without temporal/recency signals stay factual.
  - No factual query without a temporal or recency signal becomes recency.
  - classify_query() module-level convenience function is importable.
  - STRATEGY_PRESETS includes a "recency" key with the expected channel weights.
