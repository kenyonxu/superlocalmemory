"""The same question must return the same answer.

Sorting candidates by score alone is a PARTIAL order. Facts that tie keep
whatever order the input happened to arrive in, and that order comes from SQLite
page layout, dict insertion order, or which thread finished first — none of which
is data. So two runs over an unchanged store can return different answers, and
one of them is shown to the user as *the* answer.

Measured on a 517 MB store, 140 queries, two runs of identical code: 14 queries
returned a different top-10, 11 returned a different SET of facts, and 3 gave a
different single top answer. Nothing had changed between the runs.

The fix is to make every ordering total by breaking ties on `fact_id`, which is
unique and stable. `fusion.py` already did this; twenty-three other sorts and two
SQL queries did not.

Two tests here, deliberately of different kinds:

* a **behavioural** one, that tied scores come back in the same order however
  they went in — this is the property that matters;
* a **structural** one over the whole retrieval package, because the property
  holds at twenty-three separate call sites and a behavioural test for each would
  be twenty-three fixtures that still miss the twenty-fourth. The structural test
  is the one that catches a new sort added next month.
