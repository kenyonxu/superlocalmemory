"""MCP profile definitions — pure data, no side effects.

Extracted from mcp/server.py (v3.8.0) so the daemon can import profile
metadata without triggering FastMCP tool registration or engine warmup.

server.py re-exports all names from this module for backward compatibility.
Do NOT import FastMCP, MemoryEngine, or any heavy dependency here.
