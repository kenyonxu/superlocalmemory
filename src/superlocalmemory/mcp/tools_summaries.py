"""MCP surface for the readable summary layer (issue #113).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
4.0.6 shipped the summary generators with no caller at all. 4.0.7 added
``slm summary``, which fixed it for a person at a terminal and left agents with
nothing — the changelog said the defect was "no command, tool or endpoint" and
only the command was built. This is the tool half.

It matters more than the CLI: the natural consumer of "what did I work on
yesterday" is the agent holding the conversation, not a human running a command.

CONTRACT
--------
Read-only, profile-scoped, and honest about coverage. Every response carries
``coverage`` and ``source_fact_ids``, so a caller can tell a summary of 4% of a
session from a summary of all of it, and can drill back to the memories it came
from. Callers must not present a partial summary as complete; the field exists
precisely so they do not have to guess.

NOT ON THE HOT PATH. Summaries read memory.db directly and are invoked on
demand; nothing here runs during remember or recall.
