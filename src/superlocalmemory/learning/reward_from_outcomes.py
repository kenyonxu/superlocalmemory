"""Settle a bandit play from an authenticated outcome.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
``reward_proxy.py`` has said since v3.4.22:

    Replaced in v3.4.22 by ``reward_from_outcomes.py`` — DO NOT extend this
    module beyond the proxy window contract.

That file was never written. So the replacement never arrived, and the module
that tells you not to extend it remained the only settlement path — one that
cannot work. Measured, not inferred:

* ``reward_proxy._tool_event_hit`` selects ``payload_json`` from ``tool_events``
  ``WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN ? AND ?``. **Neither column exists** on that
  table, on this install or in any DDL in the codebase. The query raises
  ``no such column: payload_json``, a bare ``except sqlite3.Error`` returns
  False, and the "cited" branch of the ladder is therefore unreachable.
* Even with the names corrected there would be nothing to find: **0 of 2,002**
  ``tool_events`` rows on a live store contain a 16-hex token, let alone a
  real ``fact_id``. That table records tool names and summaries, not the
  memories a recall returned.

So every settlement fell through to the 120-second default of 0.5, which is
visible in the arms as an exact tie::

    SUM(alpha) = SUM(beta) = 867.5 = 165 priors + 1,405 plays x 0.5

WHAT THIS USES INSTEAD
----------------------
``action_outcomes`` (memory.db, M006) — the table an *explicit* outcome report
already writes, with a reward the reporter chose:
``success=1.0 / failure=0.0 / partial=0.5``. That is an authenticated signal
about whether the memories helped, which is exactly what a play needs and what
an exposure is not.

It carries ``recall_query_id``, a join key straight to ``bandit_plays.query_id``.
Since 4.1.25 that id is the one recall returns as ``query_id`` (one identity
from engine to play), and every surface writes it through
``outcome_events``. When it is present the outcome settles exactly
that play; only an outcome that names no recall falls back to overlap between
its ``fact_ids_json`` and the ``shown_fact_ids`` the play recorded (M044).

An outcome is spent once: its id is written on the play it settled, in the
same transaction as the posterior change, under a unique index (M055).

THE GRACE WINDOW, AND WHY IT IS NOT 120 SECONDS
-----------------------------------------------
``reward_proxy`` defaults a play to 0.5 once it is 120 seconds old. A human or
an agent deciding whether a memory helped does not do so within two minutes, so
that deadline would claim every play before any real outcome arrived — the
default would win a race it should not be in.

A play that recorded ``shown_fact_ids`` therefore waits ``_GRACE_SEC`` (default
900) before it may be defaulted. A play with no recorded facts keeps the old
120-second behaviour, because nothing can ever settle it from evidence and
holding it open buys nothing.

NOTHING HERE FABRICATES A REWARD. If no outcome is reported, the play settles
neutral and is *labelled* ``default`` so it stays distinguishable from a
genuinely neutral outcome. Those two were indistinguishable before, which is why
this went unnoticed for months.
