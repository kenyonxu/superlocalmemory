"""Sleep-Time Consolidation Worker — **back-compat shim**.

As of v3.4.22 (F4.A Stage-8 H-01 fix), the 1344-LOC god-module was
split into five cohesive files:

  - ``consolidation_cycle.py``     — :class:`ConsolidationWorker`.
  - ``pattern_miner.py``           — :func:`generate_patterns`.
  - ``ranker_retrain_legacy.py``   — deprecated cold-start path.
  - ``ranker_retrain_online.py``   — LLD-10 candidate seams.
  - ``ranker_common.py``           — training-matrix + NDCG helpers.

This shim exists so that the 3830 live tests + dashboard + MCP tools +
managed server routes keep importing from
``superlocalmemory.learning.consolidation_worker`` with zero churn.

Tests that ``monkeypatch.setattr(cw_mod, "_train_booster", fake)`` work
unchanged because :func:`_run_shadow_cycle` is defined here and resolves
its helper names through *this* module's globals.

#: Distinct informative labels required before a retrain is worth running.

#: Measured on a live production store: ``learning_features`` holds 5,352 rows, of
#: which **5,350 carry label 0.0** and exactly two are non-zero (0.6 and 1.0) —
#: the two real feedback events in the whole database. The active model was
#: trained on 972 such rows and reorders results at random; the heuristic it
#: displaced was better.
#:
#: An earlier design proposed gating on ``len(set(labels)) <= 1``. That check PASSES
#: here — three distinct values exist — and would train on a 2,675:1 imbalance
#: while reporting success, which is worse than not training at all because it
#: looks like progress. A count of informative labels is the honest gate.
