"""Per-fact outcome score: read it, update it, and damp it honestly.

WHAT IT IS
----------
One number per (fact, profile): an exponentially-weighted average of the rewards
of the settlements that fact took part in. Ranking otherwise scores a memory
purely by how much it *resembles* the query — nothing in the pipeline knows
whether a memory has ever actually helped.

WHY IT IS NOT A MODEL FEATURE, WHICH AN EARLIER DESIGN GOT BACKWARDS
----------------------------------------------------------------
An earlier design said to add ``"outcome_score"`` to ``FEATURE_NAMES`` for inference and
exclude it from the training matrix. That cannot work, and the model's own
closing gotcha says why: ``booster.predict(X)`` needs the same columns in the
same order the model was trained on. A feature present at inference and absent
in training is a shape mismatch, not a clever exclusion.

Two more reasons, both checkable: ``features.py`` asserts
``len(FEATURE_NAMES) == FEATURE_DIM`` with ``FEATURE_DIM = 20``, and
``routes/brain.py`` surfaces that constant as ``feature_count_expected``. The
live model is a 20-feature model. Adding a 21st silently invalidates it.

So PCOS is applied AFTER the model score, as a bonus on the ranking score. That
satisfies this true by construction: there is nothing to exclude from
training because it never enters training. Self-reinforcement — "model learns
high PCOS wins, which raises PCOS" — is impossible when the model cannot see it.

THE TWO DAMPING RULES, AND WHAT EACH IS FOR
-------------------------------------------
**Confidence weighting.** A fact settled once at reward 1.0 is not a fact that
works; it is a fact that worked once. The bonus is scaled by
``log1p(play_count) / log1p(20)``, so a single settlement contributes ~1/5 of
what twenty do, and an unsettled fact contributes exactly nothing rather than
being penalised for being new.

**Rich-get-richer.** A fact that ranks well gets shown, gets settled, ranks
better. Measured over 1,000 simulated queries with near-tied retrieval scores,
the single most-favoured fact took first place in 5.30% of them with the bonus
on and 1.30% with it off — so the bonus alone breaks the release limit
of "no fact above 5%". The counter-pressure is ``RecentTopCounter``: once a fact
has won first place ``_CAP_MIN`` times inside a rolling window it stops
receiving the bonus. Not removed and not demoted — a memory that genuinely keeps
being relevant must stay returnable. It only stops compounding.

    WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT OPTIONAL. Measured over a
    1,000-query simulation with 200 facts and near-tied retrieval scores
    (spread 0.02, which is what an embedding channel actually returns for
    closely related memories), the single most-favoured fact took first place:

        no outcome bonus          1.30% of queries
        bonus, MAX_BONUS = 0.15   5.30% of queries

    The release limit is "no fact reaches more than 5% of displays over
    a 1,000-query simulation". The bonus alone breaks it. A control run with the
    bonus disabled sits at 1.30% at every spread, so the bonus is the cause and
    not the tie-breaking — that control is the only reason this is known.

    HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE PLAN. The original countermeasure multiplies a capped
    fact's ``ranking_score`` by 0.1. That is a 10x demotion of a memory whose
    only offence is having been useful three times, and it would visibly damage
    answers — a genuinely relevant memory must stay returnable. This instead
    withholds the BONUS from a fact that has recently been winning. The fact
    keeps every point retrieval gave it and simply stops compounding.

    WHY A ROLLING WINDOW RATHER THAN A SESSION. ``run_recall`` has no
    ``session_id`` parameter, so there is no session identity at this layer to
    key on, and threading one through every caller to bound an in-memory
    counter is not worth it. A rolling window over the last ``_WINDOW`` queries
    per profile gives the same property — recent concentration is what
    compounds — without new plumbing. In-process and ephemeral on purpose: a DB
    write per displayed fact per query is exactly the contention the exposure
    enqueue was switched off to avoid.
