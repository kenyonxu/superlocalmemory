"""SuperLocalMemory V3 — Entity Resolution.

Maps variant mentions ("Alice", "Ms. Smith", "she") to canonical entities.
Persists ALL resolution results to DB — the #1 fix from the V1 audit where
entity resolution ran but results were silently discarded.

Tiers, strongest evidence first (rules and their sources: entity_match.py):
  a) Exact match in canonical_entities (case-insensitive)
  b) Exact alias match in entity_aliases (case-insensitive; entity_match.alias_in_use)
  c) The same name once normalized, or one typo in one word, compared with
     canonical names only -- never with aliases, so merges cannot chain
  d) Mode B/C only: a borderline pair the local model confirms
Before 4.1.25 tier (c) was whole-string Jaro-Winkler >= 0.85 against names and
aliases alike; such an alias (source 'jaro_winkler') answers an exact lookup
only while the new rules would still accept it.
