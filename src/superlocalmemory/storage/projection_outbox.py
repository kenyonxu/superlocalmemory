"""The queue that makes a cross-engine projection write impossible to lose.

The graph lives in CozoDB (RocksDB underneath) and the vectors in LanceDB. Both
are separate storage engines from SQLite, so no transaction can span them and
there is no two-phase commit to reach for. The obvious sequence — commit the
fact, then write the projection — has a window in the middle. A process killed
inside that window leaves a memory that exists in SQLite, is absent from the
graph, and is therefore unrecallable, with nothing anywhere recording that it
happened.

This module is the transactional-outbox side of the answer. A row naming the
fact is written **inside the same SQLite transaction as the fact itself**, so
the intent to project is exactly as durable as the fact. A worker later claims
the row, applies it to Cozo and Lance, and only then deletes it. Killed at any
point, the row is still there and the work is retried.

WHAT THE ROW CARRIES, AND WHY IT IS SO THIN
-------------------------------------------
Only a fact id, a profile, and an intent. Not the entities, not the edges, not
the embedding. The drain re-reads the fact's current state from SQLite at the
moment it projects.

That choice buys idempotency for free. Replaying a row can only ever write the
present truth, so a retry after a crash, a double delivery, and an intent that
was superseded three times while queued all converge on the same correct
projection. Serialising a snapshot into the row instead would mean replaying
stale state over fresh state — the classic outbox bug.

WHY THE PRIMARY KEY IS THE FACT ID
----------------------------------
It coalesces. Ten writes to one fact are one unit of work, because the drain
re-derives everything anyway. It also puts a hard ceiling on the table:
**at most one row per fact, so the queue can never exceed the store.** That is
what makes it safe to queue unconditionally on a machine where no projection
has been built yet — the backlog is bounded by the fact count and is precisely
the set of facts a future migration needs to project.

LATEST INTENT WINS
------------------
``op`` is replaced on conflict rather than appended, so a delete queued after an
upsert leaves one row saying ``delete``. A queue that kept both would depend on
draining them in order to avoid resurrecting a forgotten memory; this one cannot
get that wrong because there is only ever one intent to read.

``revision`` IS A CONCURRENCY TOKEN, NOT A COUNTER
--------------------------------------------------
The drain claims a row, spends time in Cozo, then clears it. A write landing in
that gap must not be discarded. So every enqueue bumps ``revision``, and the
clear is conditional on the revision the drain claimed. If it moved, the delete
matches nothing and the new intent stays queued. A timestamp would not do:
two enqueues inside one clock tick would be indistinguishable.

FAILURE POLICY
--------------
``enqueue`` is allowed to raise, and the caller's transaction then rolls back
the fact along with it. That is deliberate: this is a durability mechanism, and
a durability mechanism that silently degrades to best-effort is the defect it
exists to remove. The one expected absence — a store old enough not to have the
table — is answered by :func:`is_available` rather than by an exception, so an
un-migrated store keeps working and simply queues nothing.
