    WHY AN EDGE WITH A WITHHELD ENDPOINT IS NOT A LOGICAL EDGE
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    The retrieval channel this projection stands in for does not traverse them.
    It loads ``graph_edges`` by scope and then prunes the result: "Edge scope
    alone cannot authorize an endpoint. Prune both endpoints against the visible
    fact corpus so denied facts cannot influence an allowed candidate indirectly
    through propagation." Its entity map is filtered the same way, for a reason
    it spells out — a withheld row carries its whole cluster's pooled entity
    list, so it out-ranks real memories and then gets discarded at hydration,
    spending the channel's budget on nothing.

    The export predated that fix and kept the withheld endpoints. Measured on a
    copy of the author's store: Cozo's bridge held 1,257 facts the store may not
    return and its edges touched 805, and the graph search diverged from SQLite
    on **every** query — three shadow checks, three mismatches. One query
    returned 9 results against SQLite's 20, because withheld facts had taken the
    top-k budget. The projection failed closed every time, so recall was correct
    and the projection was dead weight.

    The predicate is resolved against the passed connection because
    ``archive_status`` and ``quarantined`` each arrive with a migration and may
    be absent on a store the engine has not opened.
