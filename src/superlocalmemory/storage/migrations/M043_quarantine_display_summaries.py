"""M043 — take model-written summaries out of the retrieval corpus.

Runs unattended on upgrade. Three steps, in this order, all idempotent:

  1. PRESERVE — copy every consolidator-authored row's text into
     ``consolidated_summaries``, the display-only table, so nothing the user
     could see today disappears from view.
  2. WITHHOLD — set ``atomic_facts.quarantined = 1`` on those rows. They stay
     on disk, with their provenance, and stop being answers.
  3. RESTORE — un-hide genuine memories whose retention row says they are
     maximally retained but whose zone says 'archive'.

WHY THIS IS A MIGRATION AND NOT A ONE-OFF SCRIPT
------------------------------------------------
About three quarters of this product's users are not engineers. A repair that
requires reading a runbook, cloning a repository or running SQL is a repair
they will not get. The store is the whole point of the product, so a defective
store has to fix itself on the next start, whether they installed by pip, npm
or from source.

DEFERRED, NOT EAGER
-------------------
``atomic_facts`` is bootstrapped by ``MemoryEngine.initialize()``, which runs
*after* ``apply_all``. Every existing migration that touches it — M011, M013,
M015, M016 — is deferred for that reason and this one is no different. Deferred
migrations are snapshotted: ``apply_deferred`` takes a verified backup lazily,
immediately before the first migration that will actually apply
(``migration_runner.py``, ``_ensure_snapshot``), using the sqlite3 backup API
rather than a file copy, which cannot snapshot a live WAL database.

WHAT IT IS REPAIRING, MEASURED
------------------------------
On the author's 5,089-fact store, before this ran:

    rows written by the consolidator into atomic_facts     1,195
      ...retrieval-eligible (retention zone not archive)     307
      ...that are summaries of other summaries              353
      ...carrying a temporal_events row                        0
      ...violating the declared FK to memories             1,195
    genuine memories archived by consolidation              528
      ...archived by anything other than consolidation        0
      ...whose retention score is 1.0 (i.e. "keep")         528

Asked "what am I working on", ranks 1, 2 and 3 all read "Unfortunately, there
is no information available about 'Gateway', 'State', 'Bounded', or 'Claude' in
the provided text."

THE THREE PREDICATES, AND WHY EACH IS EXACT
-------------------------------------------
**Which rows are consolidator-authored.** ``memory_id = ''`` *and* present in
``fact_consolidations``. Verified to agree exactly on the real store: 1,195
either way, zero rows on either difference, and zero genuine facts with a
dangling ``memory_id`` that could be swept up by accident. Both halves are
required so that a future fact with an empty ``memory_id`` — or a consolidation
record pointing at a real fact — is left alone.

Content matching was considered and rejected. Only 34 of the 307
retrieval-eligible rows read as refusals; the other 273 are fluent, plausible,
generic prose that no honest predicate separates from a real summary. Repairing
by content would have cleared a ninth of the problem and looked finished.

**Which memories to un-hide.** ``lifecycle_zone IN ('archive','forgotten')``
together with ``retention_score > 0.8``. That combination is a contradiction on
its own terms: ``math/ebbinghaus.py:lifecycle_zone`` maps any score above 0.8 to
'active', so a row scoring 1.0 and filed under 'archive' was put there by
something that did not consult the score. Consolidation was that something, but
the predicate does not need to know it — which is what makes it safe to re-run
forever, and self-limiting: it describes an inconsistency, so it empties itself.

The restored zone is *recomputed* from the score with the same thresholds, not
guessed. Guessing 'warm' would have quietly demoted 528 facts that the maths
already called 'active'.

**Which summaries to preserve.** All of them, including the refusals. A reader
looking at their dashboard should see what their store actually generated;
silently dropping the embarrassing ones would hide the problem this repair
exists to fix. W5 renders them, and its own tests cover not showing junk as
though it were insight.

#: memories on the author's store scored exactly 1.0, so it worked there — and
#: that store is the LUCKY shape. Those rows scored 1.0 because they had no
#: prior retention row and the schema default is 1.0.
#:
#: On a store where the forgetting scheduler has been running (the default,
#: ``ForgettingConfig.enabled = True``) a consolidation victim carries whatever
#: score it had drifted to — typically 0.21 to 0.80 — because
#: ``set_fact_lifecycle_zone`` moves the zone and leaves the score alone. The
#: score-based predicate does not see those rows at all: they stay archived,
#: ``verify()`` returns true because it cannot see them either, and ``doctor``
#: reports healthy while the memories remain unreachable. A repair that is
#: silent about what it failed to repair is worse than one that fails loudly.
#:
#: So the test is the same one the withhold step uses: was this row a
#: consolidation source? That is recorded, and it does not depend on a number
#: that something else was free to change afterwards.
#:
#: Self-correcting rather than indiscriminate: the zone is RECOMPUTED from the
#: score, so a source that has genuinely faded maps straight back to
#: archive/forgotten and nothing moves. Only a row whose own score says it

    Only when the SCHEMA is missing. The two schema conditions here -- the
    column and the display table -- mean queries would hit something that is not
    there, so refusing is right. The other three are about DATA: a summary that
    should be withheld is not withheld, or a real memory is hidden. Those make
    some answers worse; they do not stop the store working.

    The distinction matters because this ``verify()`` is a standing guard over
    data that ordinary use can re-violate -- a consolidation pass hiding one more
    memory is enough. Treating that like a missing table meant one drifted row
    could return 503 on every route indefinitely, with a manual restart the only
    way out. That is an outage caused by a quality check, which is worse than the
    thing the check is for.

    Reported as #125, where a user's daemon sat unusable on exactly this.
