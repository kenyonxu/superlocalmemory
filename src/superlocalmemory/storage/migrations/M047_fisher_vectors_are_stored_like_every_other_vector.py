"""Rewrite the two Fisher vectors on each fact as float32, like the embedding.

WHAT THIS IS ABOUT

A fact carries three vectors of the same width: its embedding, and the diagonal
Fisher mean and variance the memory dynamics read to decide how fast it decays.
4.0.9 converted the embedding from JSON text to float32 and got 5.5x. The other
two were left in text.

Measured on a real 447 MB store:

    fisher_mean + fisher_variance    116.5 MB
    embedding (already binary)        15.5 MB
    content — the memories themselves  3.6 MB

The Fisher matrices were thirty-two times the size of the memories they
describe, and more than a quarter of the entire file, because a float printed
as decimal text costs about 22 bytes and the same float costs 4.

WHY AN UPDATE AND NOT A REBUILD

``atomic_facts`` has a TEXT primary key, so it also has an implicit rowid, and
its full-text index is external-content keyed on that rowid. Rebuilding the
table reassigns rowids and every index entry then points at a different fact —
searches keep working and return the wrong rows. An UPDATE touches no rowid, so
the search index is untouched by construction. Nothing here alters the schema:
the columns are declared TEXT and SQLite stores a BLOB in them regardless.

WHY IT CAN BE INTERRUPTED

Every row is converted independently and the read path accepts both forms, so a
store stopped halfway is a working store. Re-running finishes it. That is why
the work is committed in batches rather than held in one transaction across
three thousand facts.

WHY THE VALUES ARE COMPARED, NOT ASSUMED

float32 has about seven significant digits, and these numbers were written from
float64. The conversion therefore loses precision on purpose, and "on purpose"
has to be demonstrated rather than asserted: ``verify`` re-reads a sample and
checks each value against the text it replaced, at the tolerance float32
actually provides. The embedding conversion made the same trade and its values
matched to the last decimal that mattered.
