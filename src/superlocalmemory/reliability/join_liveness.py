"""Has a schema-guarded code path ever run against this store?

Some features are wired behind a guard that asks the schema a question before
doing any work — "is this table here, does that column exist" — and fall back
silently when the answer is no. The fallback is correct behaviour: it is what
keeps an old store openable. But it means a feature can be implemented, called
on the hot path, and covered by tests, while never once executing against real
data. Static analysis passes. A call-graph trace passes. Coverage passes. The
guard returns ``False`` and the feature is arithmetically absent.

Two things make that failure hard to see from inside the code:

1. **The guard is doing its job.** There is no error to raise. Falling back is
   the designed response to a missing column.
2. **The fallback is often a neutral value**, which composes into an identity.
   A decay-rate multiplier that falls back to a trust of 1.0 collapses
   ``lambda * (1 + kappa * (1 - trust))`` to ``lambda`` — the feature is on, and
   it computes exactly what having no feature would compute.

So this check does two things a plain schema assertion does not. It records
whether each named guard **passes right now**, and when a guard fails it looks
for the required data **elsewhere in the store** — because the common case is
not that the data is missing, it is that the guard is asking the wrong table.

A guard reported as ``SATISFIED_ELSEWHERE`` is the most actionable outcome
available: the feature is one re-keyed join away from working, and no backfill
or migration is required.
