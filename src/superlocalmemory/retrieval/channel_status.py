"""What happened to each retrieval channel on one recall.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A channel that crashes on every query and a channel that correctly found
nothing produced the same observable result: absence. Both simply had no entry
in the fused candidate map, and the only trace was a log line on a machine
nobody is reading.

That matters because the channels are not interchangeable. Lexical search
finding nothing for a conceptual question is the system working. Lexical search
raising on every question is an outage that looks, from the outside, like a
store with nothing in it — the user sees weaker answers and has no way to tell
which of the two they are getting.

There is a third case the absence hid, and it is the worst of them: a channel
that never ran. When the query embedding is unavailable, three of the five
channels are never even dispatched. Nothing in the answer said so.

WHY MORE THAN "ok / empty / error"
----------------------------------
Because the remedies differ, and a status whose remedy is ambiguous is a status
nobody acts on. ``error`` is a bug to fix. ``timeout`` is a capacity or data-size
problem. ``no_embedding`` means the embedding provider is down and several
channels are silently offline together. ``disabled`` and ``not_configured`` are
someone's deliberate choice and must not read as faults — which is the point:
without naming them, an operator reading a list of missing channels cannot tell
their own configuration apart from a failure.

STRINGS, NOT AN ENUM
--------------------
This crosses the MCP and HTTP surfaces, where it is JSON either way. A str-valued
constant serialises without a custom encoder and compares equal to what a client
sends back.
