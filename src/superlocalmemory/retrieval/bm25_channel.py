"""SuperLocalMemory V3 — BM25 Keyword Search Channel.

Persistent BM25Plus index over fact content. Catches exact name/date
matches that embedding similarity misses.

V1 bug fix: V1 kept BM25 tokens in-memory only — a restart lost
the entire index. This version persists tokens to the DB via
store_bm25_tokens / get_all_bm25_tokens and cold-loads on init.

#: leaving headroom at both ends rather than pinning everything to one corner.

def _to_unit_scale(scored: list[tuple[str, float]]) -> list[tuple[str, float]]:
    """Map BM25 scores into [0, 1) without disturbing order or magnitude.

    WHY ANY OF THIS. ``engine.apply_channel_weights`` re-scores a candidate as
    ``sum(channel_scores[ch] * weights[ch])`` — a SUM of raw channel scores.
    Every other channel is bounded: semantic cosine and Fisher-Rao are [0, 1],
    the temporal proximity score is Gaussian on [0, 1]. BM25 is not. Measured on
    a live store, one query at a time::

        "slm release"                                    max  2.845
        "memory"                                         max  3.865
        "the release ships once both audits are clean"    max 10.150

    So the sum was decided by a scale rather than by evidence, and any weight
    the bandit converged on was a correction for that scale — wrong the moment
    the query length changed.

    WHY NOT DIVIDE BY THE BATCH MAXIMUM. That was the first implementation here
    and it is wrong, which an existing test caught before it shipped:
    ``test_real_fts5_exact_hit_keeps_bounded_slot`` exists to prove *"a real
    sub-1.0 FTS5 hit remains visible under semantic pressure"*. Dividing by the
    batch maximum makes the best result exactly 1.0 **whatever it scored**, so a
    query with one weak lexical match reports full confidence and outranks a
    semantic channel it should lose to. Batch-relative scaling manufactures
    confidence out of an empty batch, and it also makes a fact's score depend on
    which other facts happened to come back — the same query returning a
    different number on a different day, which HARD-RULES RULE 6 puts above
    speed.

    A saturating transform has neither problem: ``s / (s + k)`` is strictly
    increasing, so order is untouched; it is bounded below 1.0, so nothing is
    ever certain; and it depends only on the score itself, so it is repeatable.
    Applied to the measurements above: 2.676 -> 0.35, 2.845 -> 0.36,
    3.865 -> 0.44, 10.150 -> 0.67.

    FUSION IS UNAFFECTED, verified by reading ``fusion.weighted_rrf`` rather
    than assuming: it computes ``fused += w / (k + rank)`` and keeps the score
    only for reporting. Rescaling a value nothing divides by cannot move a
    fused rank.

    Non-positive scores map to 0.0. FTS5's ``bm25()`` is <= 0 and is negated
    here, so a value at or below zero means "no lexical evidence", and that is
    what it should contribute to a sum.
