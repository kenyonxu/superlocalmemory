"""Loading one scope's entity graph from the stores (the full build).

Moved out of retrieval/entity_channel unchanged in behaviour; the channel keeps
thin methods of the same names, which tests and the RCU builder wrap. Since
4.1.25 a full load runs only for a first build, an evicted scope, a slot whose
currency the change log cannot prove, or a background compaction
(retrieval/graph_catchup) -- never because a memory was written.
