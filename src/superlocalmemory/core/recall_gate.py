"""v3.4.32: Recall-in-flight counter used to give /search priority over the
pending materializer.

Every recall handler calls ``begin_recall()`` on entry and ``end_recall()``
in a finally block. The pending-memory materializer thread polls
``in_flight()`` and sleeps while any recall is active, so the shared
embedder worker never serves a materialization ahead of a user-initiated
recall.
