"""The worker that carries queued facts into CozoDB and LanceDB.

One writer, one direction: SQLite is canonical, the projections are derived, and
this is the only thing that writes them during normal operation. Making it the
sole writer is what removes the class of bug this replaced — a projection write
attempted inline on the store path, on whichever thread happened to be storing,
with its failure swallowed into a debug log.

WHAT IT PROJECTS IS WHAT RECALL CAN RETURN
------------------------------------------
Not "lifecycle in (active, warm)", which is what the inline sync used. That
predicate was wrong twice over: it dropped ``cold``, which is a live tier that
recall answers from, and it never removed a fact that had since been archived,
leaving forgotten memories reachable through the graph.

The filter here is ``visible_fact_clause()`` — the same predicate every read
path uses to decide whether a row may be shown as a memory at all. Deriving the
projection from the same clause means the two cannot drift: if recall can return
it, it is projected; the moment it cannot, it is removed.

FAILURE IS LOUD
---------------
A projection write that raises leaves its row queued with the attempt counted
and the error recorded. Nothing is dropped, and the queue depth is a health
metric, so a projection that has stopped keeping up is visible instead of
silent. That is the entire point of the mechanism and it is why nothing in this
module catches an exception and continues as though it had not happened.

AFTER A BULK IMPORT, THE QUEUE IS NOT CLEARED — IT IS DRAINED
-------------------------------------------------------------
A promotion builds the whole projection from SQLite in one pass, which satisfies
every row queued before it started. Deleting those rows on that basis would need
a watermark: a timestamp taken before the import read its snapshot, with
everything older discarded. That is one off-by-one away from throwing out a
projection nobody will ever write again, in the exact mechanism whose only job
is to make that impossible.

So nothing is discarded. The worker re-projects the backlog, which is idempotent
and lands on the same graph. It costs the import's work once more, in the
background, off the hot path — a price worth paying for a rule with no edge case
in it. Queue depth right after a promotion is therefore high and falling, which
is the truth; ``stalled`` is the number that indicates trouble.

A ROW THAT KEEPS FAILING MUST NOT BLOCK THE ONES BEHIND IT
----------------------------------------------------------
The queue is claimed in ``attempts, revision`` order, so a fact whose
projection is genuinely impossible — a malformed embedding, an id Cozo refuses
— sinks to the back after its first failure and healthy work continues past it.
Ordering by revision alone would let one poisoned row starve every fact behind
it, which is the failure mode that makes queues look like outages.
