"""Ask the local model server whether a model exists, before trusting it.

Mode B runs on Ollama, and a user picking a model there picks it by typing a
name. Two things then go wrong silently.

**The name is wrong.** Nothing happens at the moment of the mistake; the config
saves, the daemon starts, and every write quietly falls back to a worse path.
The error a user eventually sees is unrelated to what they did.

**The name is right and the shape is different.** Every embedding model emits a
vector of a fixed width. `nomic-embed-text` emits 768 numbers,
`mxbai-embed-large` emits 1024. Vectors of different widths cannot be compared,
so a store holding both answers similarity questions with noise — and it does so
without failing, because nothing in a similarity search knows the difference
between a bad answer and a good one. **This is the single silent-and-catastrophic
change a user can make**, so it is refused rather than warned about, and the
refusal says the one command that would make it safe.

There are two Ollama roles and they are separate models with separate names:
the embedding model (`embedding.ollama_model`) turns text into vectors, and the
generation model (`llm.model` when the provider is Ollama) writes summaries.
They are validated independently because a machine can perfectly well have one
and not the other.
