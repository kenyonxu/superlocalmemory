"""SuperLocalMemory V3.4.11 "Scale-Ready" — Graph Pruning Engine.

Reduces graph_edges count without losing meaningful connections:
  1. Orphan removal: edges where source/target no longer exists
  2. Self-loop removal: edges where source == target
  3. Duplicate removal: keeps highest-weight edge per (source, target, type)
  4. Supersedes chain collapse: A→B→C becomes A→B + A→C (B→C removed)

CRITICAL: Never deletes facts. Only prunes graph EDGES.
All operations are profile-scoped and idempotent.

    Fix A: accepts a DatabaseManager as the first argument (preferred) to

    the lock-storm contribution from the legacy open-own-connection pattern.

    For backward compatibility a ``str | Path`` is also accepted: a temporary
    DatabaseManager is constructed from it with a deprecation warning.

    Each DELETE strategy now runs in its own short transaction (≤ _BATCH_SIZE
    rows) with a brief yield between batches.  This caps the WAL write-lock
    hold to < 10 ms per batch instead of potentially 30+ seconds for the
    full prune.

    v3.8.4-G (#84): two new parameters for config-driven thinning:
      - ``max_degree``: per-node in/out degree cap (default = _MAX_DEGREE_PER_NODE=100).
      - ``min_edge_weight``: edges with weight strictly below this floor are
        discarded before any other step.  Default 0.0 = no floor (current behaviour).

    NOTE (Flaw 2 from CRIT): orphan IDs are read once upfront, then deleted
    in batches.  New orphan edges created by the materialiser DURING a prune
    run are NOT in the initial ID list and will be pruned on the NEXT cycle.
    The ``total_after`` stat therefore reflects reality after the last batch
    completes, which may be slightly different from total_before - removed.
    This is acceptable — no data loss, just a stat nuance.

    Returns stats dict with counts for each strategy.
