"""What "status" means, in one place, for every surface that answers it.

Three surfaces answered the same question — MCP ``get_status``, the HTTP
dashboard and ``slm status`` — and returned three different field sets. Two of
them omitted the graph counts, which are the numbers that say whether the graph
is healthy; one omitted the version, which is the first thing anyone asks for
in a bug report. Each carried its own copy of the same three COUNT queries.

This module holds the agreed field set and the queries behind it. A surface may
add fields of its own — the dashboard needs a display name for the mode, the
daemon needs its own pid and uptime — but it may not be missing one of these.
