"""Phase 1 admission gateway — resolve_actor + admit + @admits decorator.

This module is the single shared admission API for MCP, CLI, and HTTP transports.
HTTP already uses the registry directly (unified_daemon.py:3740); this module
wires the same evaluation to MCP tools and CLI commands.

INVARIANT: resolve_actor() derives ActorContext from server-side facts only.
           Never call it with data from the MCP/CLI request body.

Key design choices
------------------
- Personal/single-user mode → OWNER (frictionless). Zero new friction.
- Enterprise mode + no principal → ANONYMOUS → denied for mutations.
- admit() raises AdmissionDenied on deny so the caller can return a clean error.
- @admits(kind) is a thin async decorator for MCP tools.
- coverage_self_check() is called at daemon startup.
- Fail-closed: config.toml present but unreadable → enterprise (not personal).
