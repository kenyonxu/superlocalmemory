"""Graph structural analysis -- PageRank, community detection, centrality.

Reads BOTH graph_edges and association_edges for the full graph picture.
Stores results in fact_importance table.
Called during consolidation (Phase 5), not at query time.

v3.4.1: Added Leiden community detection (optional), TF-IDF community labels,
bridge score detection. Frontend uses Louvain; backend uses Leiden/LP.
