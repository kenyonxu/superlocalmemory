    multi-hop / low-confidence queries far better than the local Ollama model.
    So an unset ``fast`` defaults to True — skip the internal agentic round and
    let the calling LLM drive refinement — whenever ``retrieval.client_driven_agentic``
    is on (the ship default). An explicit ``True``/``False`` from the caller
    always wins (the dashboard search path passes ``True`` for a snappy list;
    a no-smart-client deployment can pass ``False``). Env override
    ``SLM_HOT_PATH_INTERNAL_AGENTIC=1`` forces internal-agentic-on globally.

    This is the single resolution point: every recall path (HTTP, MCP, CLI,
