"""Whole-graph structural metrics for ``fact_importance``.

WHAT THIS IS FOR
----------------
Recall multiplies a candidate's activation by ``min(1 + pagerank * 2, 2)`` at
every hop and biases it toward the communities its query seeds belong to. Both
numbers come from ``fact_importance``. A memory missing from that table is found
by the graph walk and then ranked as though it had no position in the graph at
all -- so the table's coverage is a recall-quality property, not a reporting
nicety.

WHY ONE WRITER
--------------
Two writers were filling this table with numbers that do not mean the same
thing. The whole-graph pass (``core/graph_analyzer.py``) computes PageRank over
every fact and edge. A second path compiled an entity's facts and, on finding no
PageRank for them, computed its own over a ``LIMIT 50`` slice of facts sharing
that one entity -- a near-clique of at most 50 nodes, which hands every member
roughly ``1/n``. Measured on the author's store: the whole-graph pass produced a
maximum of 0.008744 and a median of 0.000214, while the local pass wrote 0.1 --
**eleven times the largest real score, and roughly 470x the median**. Those facts
took the maximum hop boost the formula allows (1.2 against everyone else's
1.0004) for no reason other than having shared an entity with a few others, and
they were written with no community, so the community bias could not see them
either. The signal was not stale, it was wrong.

So: one function computes this table, and it computes it over the whole graph.

WHICH ENGINE, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE GRAPH ENGINE
-----------------------------------------------
Two adapters compute the same function of the same edge set. In-process wins on
measurement, so it is the default. Timed on a copy of the author's 208,151-edge
store, each algorithm alone, warmed:

    algorithm     in process   graph engine   winner
    PageRank          0.36 s        0.38 s    tie
    Louvain           1.98 s        5.17 s    in process, 2.6x
    whole pass        2.33 s        5.56 s    in process, 2.4x

An earlier reading of 1.88 s for ``nx.pagerank`` against 0.13 s was a cold scipy
import counted as compute -- the third time a first-call warm-up has been
misread as a backend difference in this release. Both engines are deterministic
across runs (checked, not assumed) and agree to Spearman rho 0.996, so the choice
is a cost decision and may be revisited by measurement, not by argument.

The graph engine still earns its keep, just not here: reading the adjacency for
one recall measured 395 ms against SQLite's 2,477 ms on the same store, 6.3x, and
the gap widens with edge count. That is a latency win on the recall path; this
pass is background work where 2 s versus 5 s buys nothing.

Its ``pagerank()``/``community_detect()`` helpers are NOT used and could not have
been: they take their node set from the ``entity`` relation and their edges from
``edge``, which hold canonical entity IDs and fact IDs respectively.
``pagerank()`` therefore indexes an entity-keyed dict with a fact ID, raises
KeyError, and returns ``{}`` -- verified against the real store, where it
returned nothing and ``community_detect`` returned 1,386 singleton communities of
entities and not one fact. The adapter here calls the native
``PageRank``/``CommunityDetectionLouvain`` fixed rules, which operate on whatever
relation they are handed.

WHAT COUNTS AS A NODE, AND AS AN EDGE
-------------------------------------
Nodes are the profile's *visible* facts, isolated ones included: a fact with no
edges still needs a row, or the ranker treats "no position in the graph" and "not
computed yet" as the same thing. Edges come from ``iter_logical_edges``, which
already excludes any edge with a withheld or soft-deleted endpoint -- the same
predicate the retrieval channel prunes its adjacency with. The previous
whole-graph pass read ``graph_edges`` and ``atomic_facts`` raw, so it ranked
1,299 unreturnable facts alongside real memories and diluted every real score.

PageRank runs on the edge-connected subgraph and the isolated facts are then
given the uniform teleport share ``(1 - damping) / N`` over the full node set,
with the connected scores scaled to leave room for it. That convention lives
here, in the port, so both engines produce numbers on one scale -- the ranker
reads absolute values, so an engine swap that shifted the scale would silently
re-tune every boost in the system.
