"""Fact consolidation — writes a DISPLAY summary, never a memory.

Groups warm/cold facts that share an entity and writes one summary per cluster
into ``consolidated_summaries``, a display-only table. Nothing in the retrieval
corpus is created, modified or hidden by this module.

WHAT CHANGED AND WHY IT HAD TO
------------------------------
From v3.6.4 to 4.0.9 this module ended each cluster with a raw
``INSERT INTO atomic_facts`` carrying ``memory_id=''``, ``importance=0.8`` and
``entities_json`` holding *every* entity in the cluster. Three consequences, all
measured on the author's 5,089-fact store:

  * 1,195 model-written rows entered the retrieval corpus, and because each
    carried its whole cluster's entity list they had more entity links than any
    real memory, so the entity channel ranked them first. Asked "what am I
    working on", the store answered "Unfortunately, there is no information
    available about 'Gateway', 'State', 'Bounded', or 'Claude' in the provided
    text." at ranks 1, 2 and 3.
  * The rows had no ``temporal_events`` at all (0 of 1,195), so they won the
    temporal channel through its ``created_at`` recency fallback as well.
  * Their entity clusters made them eligible for consolidation in turn: 353 of
    them are summaries of summaries. A store summarising its own summaries
    drifts away from what the user actually said, one pass at a time.

Bypassing ``DatabaseManager`` also bypassed the constraint that would have
refused the row outright — ``atomic_facts`` declares
``FOREIGN KEY (memory_id) REFERENCES memories(memory_id)`` and ``memories`` has
no ``''`` row, but ``storage/memory_write.py`` sets only ``busy_timeout``, not
``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON``.

So the boundary this module now keeps is the one v3.6 intended: a summary is a
*view* of memory, shown on the dashboard and to Mode B/C readers, and it is not
a thing recall can return. ``community_summaries`` is the precedent.

CONTRACT
--------
  1. NEVER writes to ``atomic_facts`` — not the summary, not the sources.
  2. NEVER archives the source facts. Archiving them made sense only while a
     retrievable summary stood in for them; a display-only summary does not, so
     archiving would replace ten reachable memories with nothing.
  3. Model output is cleaned (``clean_llm_summary``) and then rejected if it is
     a non-answer (``is_non_answer``) — checked before any write, with the
     reason logged.
  4. Only clusters warm/cold facts; never touches 'active' or 'pinned'.
  5. All writes per cluster wrapped in SAVEPOINT for atomicity.
  6. Entity ID LIKE patterns use JSON-boundary quoting to prevent substring
     false positives.

Modes: A extractive, B Ollama, C cloud LLM with fallbacks down to extractive.

    Concurrency fix (v3.8.4 — implements TODO from Fix-A comment):
    When a DatabaseManager is provided the consolidation now uses per-cluster
    short write transactions instead of one long raw_connection() that held
    the write lock across Ollama / Cloud-LLM calls for every cluster after
    the first.  The fix:

      1. Discover clusters with a short memory_read() (no write lock).
      2. For each cluster: fetch fact content (memory_read()), generate the
         summary OUTSIDE any lock (Ollama / Cloud LLM may take 30 s), then
         do the SAVEPOINT write inside a short memory_write() block.

    SAVEPOINT atomicity per cluster is preserved: _consolidate_cluster still
    uses SAVEPOINT / RELEASE / ROLLBACK TO internally.

    Mode behavior:
      - Mode A: Extractive only (no LLM). Always available.
      - Mode B: Ollama LLM summarization. Falls back to extractive if Ollama is
        down OR if the model answers with a non-answer.
      - Mode C: Cloud LLM (user's configured provider), then Ollama, then
        extractive, with the same non-answer rejection at each step.

    Returns stats: consolidated, clusters_found, facts_summarized,

    Returns ``(summary_or_None, generated_by)`` where ``generated_by`` is
    'extractive', 'ollama' or 'cloud'. It used to return the text alone, which
    left no way to tell a local digest from model prose after the fact — and
    since only the model paths can produce a non-answer, that distinction is
    what makes a bad batch traceable to its source.

    Model output goes through two stages before it is offered to the caller:

      1. ``clean_llm_summary`` strips chat scaffolding *around* the answer.
         This stripper has existed in ``summaries/base.py`` since 3.6 and this
         module referenced it zero times, which is why 20 of the author's
         stored summaries begin "Here is a concise summary paragraph".
      2. ``is_non_answer`` rejects text that is scaffolding *all the way
         through* — a refusal, a request for more input, a report that the
         input was empty. Order matters: step 1 rescues "Here is a summary:
         <real content>", and running step 2 first would discard it.

    A rejected model summary falls back to extractive, which is derived
    mechanically from the facts and so cannot refuse. Falling back beats
    writing nothing: the user still gets a digest.

    All modes cap output at _MAX_CONSOLIDATED_CHARS.
