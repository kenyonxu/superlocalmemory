"""Truthful public retrieval score contract.

Retrieval produces an ordering, not an answer probability.  This module keeps
query relevance, stored assertion confidence, trust, and internal ranking
utility distinct while preserving the V3.6 aliases for one compatibility
release.

    ``score`` IS NOT THE ORDERING KEY, and a caller that sorts by it will get a
    different answer than the one this returns. That is deliberate, and it is
    load-bearing:

    * ``score`` answers "how well does this match the query" — a property of the
      result and the query alone.
    * ``rank_position``, assigned here from the order of the list, answers "what
      is recommended, and in what order". Ranking also weighs whether a memory
      has helped before and whether the session was just looking at it, neither
      of which is a property of the query.

    So the two can disagree, and the top result can legitimately carry a lower
    ``score`` than the one beneath it. Consumers should present the list in the
    order given, or sort by ``rank_position``; ``ranking_score`` carries the
    internal utility for anyone who needs to re-derive it.

    This ordering is NOT recomputed here. Re-sorting by ``score`` at this point
    would silently undo every ranking pass that ran before it.
