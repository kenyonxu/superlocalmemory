"""Memories saved before 4.2.5 get a fact for every sentence.

Since 4.2.5 a save keeps a verbatim fact for each sentence its extracted facts
miss (``encoding/coverage_facts.py``). This pass gives older memories the same,
in the daemon, in bounded batches that yield to recall.

It only reaches memories whose whole-memory fact is live. That fact already
makes every sentence retrievable, so the pass never exposes text recall could
not already find; it makes it findable one sentence at a time. A memory with an
erasure tombstone, or whose whole fact is archived, quarantined, merged,
expired or a stub, is left as it is. Coverage is judged against every fact the
memory ever had, live or not, so a corrected or forgotten sentence is not
brought back.

Each added fact is appended to ``coverage-backfill.jsonl`` (fact and memory
ids) so the pass can be undone exactly. Newest memories first: they are the
ones being asked about. ``coverage-backfill.json`` holds the last memory
reached; a stop loses nothing and a restart resumes there.
