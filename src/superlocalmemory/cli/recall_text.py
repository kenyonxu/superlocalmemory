"""Plain-text lines for ``slm recall`` that the JSON already carries.

An incomplete recall (a channel abandoned at the hang guard, an embedding model
still loading on a just-started daemon, or the daemon's over-budget keyword
fallback) used to print exactly what a complete one prints. With no results
that was "No confident match." — a confident statement about the store, made
by a search that did not look everywhere. These lines say what was skipped.
