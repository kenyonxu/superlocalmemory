"""CLI handler for ``slm db migrate``.


Thin wrapper over the canonical runner in
``superlocalmemory.storage.migration_runner``. This module owns only
the user-facing surface (stdout formatting + exit codes). All DDL +
runner logic lives in LLD-07 territory — per H15, no migration schema
is defined or duplicated here.
