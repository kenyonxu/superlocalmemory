"""The audit-trail check for a screen that asks again and again.

Walking a trail of a hundred thousand entries hashes every one of them and takes
seconds of CPU. The Compliance and Health panes ask on every visit, so asking
for the full walk each time stalled everything else the daemon was doing.

This keeps what the last complete walk established (how far the chain was
checked, and the hash it ended on) and, on the next ask, checks only the entries
added since, plus the pieces that do not depend on how many there are: that the
entry we stopped at is still the same entry, that the count matches, and the
external anchor. Entries that were already checked are walked again in full in
the background every ``FULL_RECHECK_S`` seconds, so an edit to an old entry is
still found; it is never found by skipping the walk silently, and the command
line check (``verify_report``) is always the complete one.
