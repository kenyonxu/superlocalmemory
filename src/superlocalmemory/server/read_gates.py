"""Read permission for dashboard and mesh reads when team accounts are on.

Moved out of ``unified_daemon.py`` (which re-exports the old private names) in
4.1.20, when two gaps were closed:

* **Reads sent as POST.** The READ check ran for GET only, so the dashboard
  search (``POST /api/search``) and the memory chat
  (``POST /api/v3/chat/stream``) returned memory to a caller without READ on
  the workspace. :data:`READ_ONLY_POST_PATHS` puts them under the same check.
* **Mesh reads.** ``GET /mesh/*`` proved machine access only; a signed-in user
  without READ, or anyone in company mode without a session, could read peers,
  inboxes, shared state and locks, and ``?profile=`` reached any workspace.
  :func:`mesh_read_gate` applies READ on the workspace the request names.

Every gate is a no-op until team accounts exist (single-operator installs are
unchanged) and fails closed (503) when the account store cannot be read.
