"""Short-lived recall answers and one shared run for identical questions.

Many agents ask through one daemon. Two rules keep that cheap without ever
serving an answer older than the memory it describes:

* **One run per question in flight.** Identical recalls that arrive while one
  is running wait for it and share its answer (single flight).
* **A finished answer is kept for a few seconds** and only while nothing was
  written. The key carries the store's write generation and the picture
  generation, both read when the recall starts; an answer is kept only if
  neither moved while it ran. Writes from another process are not seen here,
  so the lifetime stays short (``RECALL_CACHE_TTL_S``).

Only complete, checked answers are kept: never a busy reply, a warming-up
answer, a keyword fallback or a partial assembly. A caller's session is part
of the key when its results carry outcome markers, so one session's markers
and outcome ticket never reach another.
