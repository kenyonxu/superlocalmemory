"""Derive the dashboard's asset cache-busters from the files themselves.

``index.html`` referenced 64 static assets. 35 carried a hand-written
``?v=`` literal and 29 carried nothing, and not one of them was derived from the
file it pointed at. So the version strings looked like cache-busting and were
not: editing a JS or CSS file left its ``?v=`` reading whatever the last person
typed, which during 4.0.10 was ``022ff653`` on a file that had changed.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT FIX
-------------------------------
It does not fix a live user-facing bug, and it would be dishonest to claim it
does. Three mechanisms already stop a stale asset reaching a browser on this
server, and the first was verified against the running daemon rather than read:

  * ``/static/*`` is served ``Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`` with an
    ETag (``server/security_middleware.py``), so a browser must revalidate and
    cannot serve a cached copy without asking.
  * The unified daemon copies the whole UI tree into the data directory on every
    start (``unified_daemon.py``, ``state_path("ui")``), so an upgrade refreshes
    the files it serves.
  * ``index.html`` itself is ``no-cache``, so the page is always re-read.

What it fixes is a **trap**, and unblocks a real improvement:

  * 64 references, none tracking content. Anyone reading them concludes
    cache-busting is handled here, which is how the 4.0.10 change shipped with a
    stale literal and how the next one would too. A number that is maintained by
    hand and consulted by nobody is worse than no number.
  * The revalidation policy is the only thing making that safe, and it costs a
    conditional request per asset on every page load — 64 of them. The obvious
    optimisation is ``max-age`` with a long life, and today that change would
    turn every hand-typed literal into an immediate live bug. With versions
    derived from content it becomes safe to make. That policy change is NOT
    made here; it needs its own measurement.
  * A proxy or CDN that ignores ``no-cache`` is defeated by a URL that changes,
    not by a header.

DESIGN
------
Rewrite at serve time rather than at build time, because there is no build step:
the UI ships as source files and is copied into place. The hash is computed from
file bytes and cached on ``(size, mtime_ns)``, so a warm daemon does one ``stat``
per asset per page load and no reads. Unresolvable references keep whatever the
HTML said, so a missing file or an odd path degrades to today's behaviour rather
than breaking the page.
