"""What the Governance audit pane shows, and how sure it may say it is.

4.1.25 audit findings L-16 / G-L2 / G-H2. The pane read ``event_type``,
``actor``, ``target`` and ``result`` while the API returned ``operation`` and
``agent_id``, so rows were blank; every actor was a capability digest; the
content hash was empty; and a green "Chain verified" stood over all of it,
which a manager reads as "the contents are verified".

* Each event keeps its stored fields and gains the presentation fields, built
  from what the entry actually records (who, on what, with what outcome).
* The badge says what the chain check covered: every field (hash version 2),
  only order and the six core fields (entries written before 4.1.25), or that
  the check failed or could not run. It never defaults to "verified".
