# Installation

SLM installs as a single `slm` command, either through npm (which gives it a private Python environment) or through pipx or pip (which put it in a Python environment you control). Installing the package with npm, pipx or pip only puts the program on disk. It does not create your data folder, edit an IDE, start a daemon or download a model. Those happen when you run `slm setup`, so you decide each step. SLM supports Apple Silicon Macs, 64-bit Windows and 64-bit Linux on Python 3.12 to 3.14.

## What you need

| Requirement | Value | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 (`requires-python >=3.12,<3.15`) | `python3 --version` |
| Node.js and npm | Node 18 or later and npm 9 or later, only for the npm route | `node --version` |
| Memory | The wizard recommends 4 GB or more; images and documents need 16 GB | |
| Disk | About 500 MB for the embedding model and 130 MB for the reranker, both downloaded once | |

On Apple Silicon, setup also installs the on-device answer check (about 1.1 GB) by default, in unattended runs too; opt out with `slm setup --no-laya` or `SLM_SKIP_LAYA=1`. Other optional downloads are asked about separately: a compression model (about 560 MB) and images and documents (about 1.5 GB, see [Pictures and Documents](Pictures-and-Documents)).

## What is supported

| System | Text memory | Images and documents |
|---|---|---|
| macOS on Apple Silicon | Supported | Supported (16 GB RAM) |
| Windows x64 | Supported | Supported (16 GB RAM) |
| Linux x86_64 | Supported | Supported (16 GB RAM) |
| Intel Mac | Not supported | Not supported |
| 32-bit Windows | Not supported | Not supported |
| Linux ARM64 (aarch64, with glibc: Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora) | Supported | Supported (16 GB RAM) |
| Windows on ARM | Not supported | Not supported |

The package metadata does not block an unsupported architecture, so an install on Intel Mac or 32-bit Windows fails later, where a pinned dependency has no build for it. The npm installer checks the Python it finds and says plainly when it cannot work (an Intel build on a Mac, 32-bit on Windows, Windows on ARM, 32-bit Linux, a Node running under Rosetta), with the repair command `npm rebuild -g superlocalmemory`.

## Install

There are four ways to the same result. They all end with SLM set up on your computer and connected to your AI tools; they differ in who types the commands.

**Let your AI agent install it.** Paste this into Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or any agent that can run commands. It follows the agent setup steps in the repository (`SETUP_FOR_AGENTS.md`), asks you one question before turning on anything optional (whether you also want to find pictures, screenshots and PDFs by describing them), connects SLM to the agent you are using, and finishes with `slm doctor`.

```text
Install SuperLocalMemory on this computer for me. Follow
https://github.com/qualixar/superlocalmemory/blob/main/SETUP_FOR_AGENTS.md
step by step and show me what each step printed. Ask me only one question,
before turning on anything optional: whether I also want to find my pictures,
screenshots and PDFs by describing them. Connect SuperLocalMemory to the agent
I am using. When you finish, run slm doctor and tell me in plain words what works.
```

**One line in a terminal** (macOS and Linux). It needs no Python or Node beforehand. The script installs `uv` if it is missing, lets uv fetch its own Python for SLM, installs SLM, sets it up, starts it, connects the AI tools it finds and opens the dashboard. It never uses sudo and never touches the system Python. You download it first, so you can read it before it runs.

```bash
curl -fsSLo get-slm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualixar/superlocalmemory/main/scripts/get-slm.sh && sh get-slm.sh
sh get-slm.sh --media      # the same, and also turn on pictures and documents (needs 16 GB RAM)
```

A Windows version of the script exists in the repository (`scripts/get-slm.ps1`), but the supported Windows routes are the agent prompt, npm and pip.

**npm** and **pip** are the terminal routes described next.

**npm, the shortest terminal route.** This is the primary route: it installs the command globally and builds a private Python environment (`.slm-venv`) inside the package, so it never touches your system Python.

```bash
npm install -g superlocalmemory
npm install -g superlocalmemory --media    # also record a request to turn on pictures and documents
```

The installer searches for `python3.14`, `python3.13`, `python3.12`, then `python3` and `python`. If your supported interpreter is somewhere unusual, set `SLM_PYTHON` to its path before you run the install. A path that is not a Python 3.12 to 3.14 is refused, and the installer does not quietly pick another.

**pipx.** Good if you want an isolated command without npm.

```bash
pipx install superlocalmemory
```

**pip in a virtual environment, the other primary route.** Use this when you also want the Python API. Keep the environment active whenever you run `slm`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install superlocalmemory
```

Do not use `sudo pip`, and do not override an externally managed system Python. Do not install the same `slm` command through more than one tool.

**From a repository clone.** For contributors and researchers. The script delegates to an existing uv or pipx and refuses to run without one.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qualixar/superlocalmemory.git
cd superlocalmemory
./scripts/install.sh install       # also: upgrade, uninstall, --manager uv|pipx, --dry-run
# Windows PowerShell: .\scripts\install.ps1 -Action Install
```

## Per-system notes

**macOS (Apple Silicon).** macOS ships an older Python, so install one first, for example `brew install python@3.12`. The on-device [answer check](Answer-Check) works only here.

**Windows (x64).** Install a 64-bit Python 3.12 to 3.14 first. For the Claude Code plugin on native Windows, install SLM first with `pipx install superlocalmemory` or `python -m pip install superlocalmemory`, so `slm` is on PATH before the plugin starts it.

**Linux (x86_64).** Install Python 3.12 or later with your package manager. On Ubuntu 22.04, use the deadsnakes archive: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa && sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv`. If the system Python cannot create virtual environments, install your distribution's `python3-venv` package. A virtual environment (`python3.12 -m venv ~/.slm-venv`) avoids conflicts with the system Python.

## Activate it

Nothing is active until you run setup.

```bash
slm setup       # choose a mode and what to enable
slm warmup      # load the embedding model; downloads about 500 MB the first time
slm doctor      # check dependencies, the embedding worker and the daemon
slm status      # mode, profile, data folder, database size
```

`slm warmup` exits non-zero if recall is not ready, which makes it usable in a script. `slm doctor --fix` re-downloads missing models and installs sqlite-vec before reporting. Behind a proxy, set `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` so the model download can reach its host.

## The setup wizard

`slm setup` asks in this order. `slm setup --auto` (or no terminal) takes every default without asking: Mode A, no integrations, no auto-start.

| Step | What it asks | Default |
|---|---|---|
| 1. System check | Nothing; reports Python version, platform, RAM, the data folder and whether sentence-transformers is installed | |
| 2. Operating mode | Mode A, B or C ([Modes Explained](Modes-Explained)), then whether other profiles' shared and global memories appear in your recall | Mode A, or B if Ollama is detected; shared recall off |
| 3. Code knowledge graph | Whether to build structural maps of your repositories | On |
| 4. Models | Downloads the embedding model and the reranker; asks before the optional compression model; on Apple Silicon installs the on-device answer check, asking `[Y/n]` when interactive and installing without asking when unattended | Compression model skipped; answer check installed (Apple Silicon) |
| 5. Daemon | Always on, or shut down after 30 minutes, 1 hour or 2 hours idle | Always on |
| 6. Mesh | Agent-to-agent messaging ([Multi-Agent Memory](Multi-Agent-Memory)) | On |
| 7. Ingestion adapters | gmail, calendar, transcript | All off |
| 8. Entity compilation | Per-entity summaries | On |
| 9. Skill evolution | Background skill improvement, which makes model calls ([Skill Evolution](Skill-Evolution)) | Off |
| 10. Verification | A self-test that recall works | |

After step 10 the wizard checks that the data folder is not inside a cloud-sync folder such as iCloud, Dropbox or OneDrive, offers the concurrent-recall queue, then asks, separately and with a default of no, whether to install the Claude Code plugin and hooks, then whether to connect other detected IDEs (default yes), and whether to install the auto-start service. Declining any of these costs nothing; you can run `slm connect claude-code`, `slm connect IDE` or `slm serve install` later.

## Where your data lives

The data folder is `~/.superlocalmemory` (on Windows, `.superlocalmemory` in your user folder). Three environment variables can change it, and the first one set wins: `SLM_DATA_DIR`, then `SL_MEMORY_PATH`, then `SLM_HOME`. A configured base directory comes after them. Installers manage the program; the data folder is separate, and no installer, upgrade or uninstall moves or deletes it. It holds `memory.db`, `learning.db`, configuration, logs (`logs/daemon.log`), downloaded models under `runtimes/`, and backups.

## Run the daemon at login

```bash
slm serve install      # user-level service, no administrator rights
slm serve status
slm serve uninstall
```

`install` writes a LaunchAgent on macOS, a systemd user service on Linux and a Task Scheduler task that runs at logon on Windows. On Linux, verify the install with `slm doctor` first, and persist `SLM_DATA_DIR` in the service if you moved the data folder. For access from other computers, see `slm remote` in [CLI Reference](CLI-Reference).

## Connect your tools

```bash
slm connect --list          # which editors were detected
slm connect cursor          # write the MCP entry for a named tool
```

The per-tool targets, transports and the Claude Code and Codex plugins are in [IDE Setup](IDE-Setup). The tool profiles that decide how many MCP tools a client sees are in [MCP Tools](MCP-Tools).

## Upgrade

Package managers update the program and deliberately leave your host integrations alone.

```bash
npm install -g superlocalmemory@latest      # npm route
pipx upgrade superlocalmemory               # pipx route
python -m pip install --upgrade superlocalmemory   # pip route, environment active
slm restart
slm doctor
slm upgrade-hosts                           # preview which host integrations are stale
slm upgrade-hosts --host codex --apply      # refresh only what you reviewed
```

A few minutes after SLM first starts on a new version it checks the memory store once, read-only, and shows the result under Health in the dashboard ([Health and Repair](Health-and-Repair)). Schema migrations are additive and forward-only. There is no downgrade of the schema; to go back, use a restore point (`slm db restore-points`, `slm db prepare-downgrade`) or restore a verified copy of the whole data folder. See [Host Upgrades](Host-Upgrades) and [Embedding Models](Embedding-Models).

## Uninstall

Remove the integrations first, then the program.

```bash
slm serve uninstall                  # remove the login service
slm hooks remove                     # Claude Code hooks (add --agent codex for Codex)
slm codex remove                     # Codex skills, agents and hooks
slm media disable --remove-files     # delete the downloaded picture models, if you enabled them
npm uninstall -g superlocalmemory    # or: pipx uninstall superlocalmemory / pip uninstall superlocalmemory
```

Uninstalling removes code only. Your memories stay in the data folder, which also keeps the picture models (about 1.5 GB under `runtimes/media`) and the on-device answer-check model (`runtimes/laya`) until you remove them. To erase everything, export or back up what you need, then delete the data folder yourself.

## Install problems

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `slm: command not found` | With npm, add `$(npm prefix -g)/bin` to PATH, or run `npx superlocalmemory status`. With pip, add the Python scripts directory to PATH |
| Permission errors from npm | Do not use sudo. Point npm's prefix at a folder you own, or install inside a virtual environment |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: superlocalmemory` | Activate the environment SLM was installed into, or reinstall with `python -m pip install --force-reinstall superlocalmemory` |
| The installer says no supported Python | Install Python 3.12 to 3.14, or set `SLM_PYTHON` to its path |
| Embedding model download fails | Check the connection and proxy variables, then run `slm warmup` again |
