# MCP Tools

SLM exposes 110 tools and 9 resources through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), but a client never sees all of them by default. A named tool profile (`core`, `code`, `full`, `power`, `mesh`, `whole`) picks a fixed subset when the MCP server starts, and an AI app on another computer or on the internet gets a smaller, default-deny subset again. This page lists every tool with its parameters, the profiles that include it and whether a remote caller may use it. The registered function signatures in `src/superlocalmemory/mcp/` are the source of truth, and the profile sets are computed from `mcp/profiles.py`.

## Connecting

SLM speaks two transports and both expose the same tools. With stdio, the IDE runs `slm mcp` as a subprocess, which costs one process per open tool. With HTTP, the IDE connects to the running daemon, which shares one process.

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "superlocalmemory": { "type": "http", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp/" } } }
```

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "superlocalmemory": { "command": "slm", "args": ["mcp"] } } }
```

`slm connect IDE [--transport stdio, http or http-mcp-remote]` writes either form for you ([IDE Setup](IDE-Setup)). Over HTTP the path `/mcp/AGENT_ID` labels every write with that agent; over stdio set `SLM_AGENT_ID` in the entry's environment. The id is cleaned to letters, digits, dot, underscore and hyphen, at most 64 characters. It is attribution, not authentication. See [Multi-Agent Memory](Multi-Agent-Memory).

Every tool that reads or writes memory takes an optional `profile_id`. Empty means the active memory profile; a name routes that one call to that profile without moving the active one, and an unknown name is refused. A memory profile is a namespace, not a security boundary ([Profiles](Profiles)).

## Choosing which tools a client sees

> Current profile counts: `core` **19**, `code` **39**, `full` **58**, `power` **70**, `mesh` **9**, `whole` **110**. While pictures and documents are on, `full` and `power` each gain five tools (63 and 75).

Three environment variables decide the surface, and the first one that applies wins: `SLM_MCP_ALL_TOOLS=1` exposes all 110, then `SLM_MCP_TOOLS=a,b,c` exposes exactly the names listed, then `SLM_MCP_PROFILE` picks a named profile, and with none of them set the default applies. The default is the same set as `full`. An unknown `SLM_MCP_PROFILE` value is an error, not a silent fallback. `slm connect IDE --profile NAME` writes the variable into an IDE's entry. The choice is fixed when the server starts. It has nothing to do with the memory profile that `switch_profile` changes.

| `SLM_MCP_PROFILE` | Tools | What it holds |
|---|---:|---|
| `core` | **19** | remember, recall, search, fetch, expand, list_recent, update_memory, forget, session_init, close_session, the five Optimize tools, review_correction, list_corrections, get_memory_summary, switch_profile |
| `code` | **39** | `core`, plus the five Brain tools, the four memory-kind tools, six code-graph tools (build_code_graph, get_blast_radius, query_graph, semantic_search_code, get_review_context, detect_changes), the three bounded-loop tools, report_outcome and report_feedback |
| `full` | **58** | Everyday memory, sessions, learning, skills, Optimize, bounded loops, saved views, memory kinds, Brain tools and the nine mesh tools. This is also the default |
| `power` | **70** | `full`, plus get_version, get_mode, health, consistency_check, recall_trace, get_lifecycle_status, set_retention_policy, compact_memories, get_behavioral_patterns, audit_trail, quantize, get_retention_stats |
| `mesh` | **9** | The nine `mesh_*` tools only |
| `whole` | **110** | Every registered tool (the raw server) |

The five picture and document tools join `full` and `power` only while images and documents are turned on ([Pictures and Documents](Pictures-and-Documents)). That is read once when the server starts. The mesh tools join the default while mesh is enabled, which is the default (`SLM_MCP_MESH_TOOLS=1` forces them on). Old count-suffixed names such as `core14`, `code34`, `full50`, `power61`, `mesh8` and `whole94` still resolve to their current profile and log a deprecation warning.

Twenty-nine tools are in no named profile at all: the code-graph tools beyond the six in `code` (sixteen of them), and others such as `build_graph`, `core_memory`, `prestage_context`, `reap_processes`, `list_failed_operations` and `resolve_operation`. They appear only under `whole`, `SLM_MCP_ALL_TOOLS=1` or an explicit `SLM_MCP_TOOLS` list, and the tables below mark them "whole only". The five picture and document tools are a separate case: they are in `full` and `power` only while images are on.

## The tools

In the tables, a parameter followed by `?` is optional. The Profiles column says which named profiles include the tool (`whole` includes every tool). The Remote column says what an AI app on another computer may do: `read` means any remote key, `write` means a key that is not read-only, `mesh key` and `media key` mean the key must also be opted in, `host only` means the tool is one of the 45 tools classified as host-only, and `refused` means the tool is not on the read, write, mesh or media lists, so a remote caller cannot run it. The refusal is the generic denial, not the host-only message. Tools that only read declare MCP's `readOnlyHint`; `delete_memory`, `forget`, `resolve_operation` and `manage_view` declare `destructiveHint`.

**The `forget` naming collision.** The MCP tool `forget` runs the Ebbinghaus decay cycle and is a dry run by default. It moves memories between lifecycle zones and never deletes by query. The CLI command `slm forget QUERY` deletes memories whose text matches the query. To delete one memory over MCP, use `delete_memory`, which is not in the `core` or `code` profiles.

### Memory

| Tool | Parameters | What it does | Profiles | Remote |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `remember` | `content`, `tags`?, `project`?, `importance`?, `session_id`?, `agent_id`?, `scope`?, `shared_with`?, `idempotency_key`?, `session_date`?, `profile_id`?, `kind`?, `replaces`? | Store a memory and return an operation receipt (`operation_id`, `fact_ids`, `materialization_state`). `scope` and `shared_with` set visibility, `kind` and `replaces` classify or supersede, `idempotency_key` makes a retry safe | core, code, full, power | write |
| `recall` | `query`, `limit`?, `agent_id`?, `session_id`?, `fast`?, `include_global`?, `include_shared`?, `window`?, `as_of`?, `known_as_of`?, `valid_at`?, `include_unknown`?, `profile_id`?, `project`?, `saved_by`?, `about`?, `kind`?, `prefer_project`?, `tags`?, `tags_match`?, `project_strict`?, `show_weak`?, `include_related`?, `depth`?, `max_tokens`?, `budget_s`? | Multi-channel retrieval with the same filters as `slm recall` (project, kind, tags, time windows, scope). Returns Score Contract results plus a `tier` (`supported`, `related` or `none`), `abstention_note`, `warming_up` and the answer-check fields. When nothing supports the question it returns no results and says so; `include_related=true` adds up to three labelled close memories, `show_weak=true` shows every weak match, `depth` (0 glance, 1 full, 2 with context) and `max_tokens` shape and cap the reply. A question waits for its full answer. `budget_s` is for a caller that blocks a turn on recall (a per-message prefetch): recall then answers inside that many seconds, with unchecked keyword matches when the full search cannot finish. When every recall slot is busy the tool returns `code: RECALL_BUSY`; wait a few seconds and ask again, it says nothing about the memory. See [How Recall Works](How-Recall-Works) | core, code, full, power | read |
| `search` | `query`, `limit`?, `kind`?, `profile_id`?, `tags`?, `tags_match`?, `depth`?, `max_tokens`? | Full-text search over memories (FTS5, BM25 ranking), with kind and tag filters. Each result carries a `tier`: `supported`, or `related` (at most three) when none is supported, with `abstention_note` saying so. `depth` and `max_tokens` work as in `recall` | core, code, full, power | read |
| `fetch` | `fact_ids`, `profile_id`? | Full details for specific fact ids, comma-separated or as a list | core, code, full, power | read |
| `expand` | `memory_id`, `depth`? (default 2), `max_tokens`?, `profile_id`? | Drill into one recall result: the full memory plus, at depth 2, its source memory, up to three memories from the same session, up to three about the same entities and the correction that replaced it. Takes a result's `fact_id` or `memory_id` and applies the same profile and visibility checks as `fetch`. `max_tokens` is never exceeded | core, code, full, power | refused |
| `list_recent` | `limit`?, `kind`?, `profile_id`?, `tags`?, `tags_match`? | Most recent memories, newest first, with optional kind and tag filters | core, code, full, power | read |
| `update_memory` | `fact_id`, `content`, `agent_id`?, `profile_id`? | Replace the text of one memory by exact fact id | core, code, full, power | write |
| `delete_memory` | `fact_id`, `agent_id`?, `profile_id`? | Delete one memory by exact fact id | full, power | write |
| `review_correction` | `case_id`, `action`, `expected_version`, `event_valid_until`?, `profile_id`? | Apply, reject or roll back a review-gated correction case; `expected_version` guards against stale reviews | core, code, full, power | write |
| `list_corrections` | `limit`?, `profile_id`? | List correction cases for a human or host reviewer | core, code, full, power | read |
| `switch_profile` | `profile_id` | Change the active memory profile. This is a different concept from the MCP tool profile that decides which tools you see | core, code, full, power | host only |
| `core_memory` | `action`, `fact_id`?, `profile_id`? | Manage the Core Memory pin set: `action` is `pin`, `unpin` or `list`. A pinned fact is always injected | whole only | write |

## What a remote app may call

A remote caller is an AI tool on another computer using a key from `slm remote keys add`, or a web app connected through [Web Access and Connected Apps](Web-Access-and-Connected-Apps). The policy in `server/remote_tool_policy.py` is default-deny. 110 tools are registered. The policy classifies 109 of them: 31 read tools, 23 write-only tools, 5 mesh tools, 5 media tools and 45 host-only tools. `expand` is not in those lists. A remote caller cannot run it, because anything outside the read, write, mesh and media lists is refused, and the denial is the generic one rather than the host-only message. The policy's classification test expects every registered name to appear in exactly one of those sets; `expand` does not.

| Class | Tools |
|---|---|
| Read (any remote key) | fetch, get_assertions, get_attribution, get_behavioral_patterns, get_brain_evidence_status, get_learned_patterns, get_lifecycle_status, get_memory_summary, get_mode, get_retention_stats, get_soft_prompts, get_status, get_version, health, list_corrections, list_recent, memory_kinds_status, memory_used, prestage_context, recall, recall_trace, review_memory_kinds, run_view, search, skill_health, skill_lineage, slm_cache_get, slm_loop_history, slm_loop_show, slm_optimize_stats, slm_retrieve |
| Write (a key that is not read-only, in addition to the read tools) | close_session, confirm_memory_kinds, contradict_assertion, core_memory, correct_pattern, delete_memory, finalize_cognitive_turn, log_tool_event, manage_view, observe, record_agent_experience, record_cognitive_turn, reinforce_assertion, remember, report_feedback, report_outcome, review_correction, session_init, set_memory_kind, settle_session_outcomes, slm_cache_set, slm_compress, update_memory |
| Mesh (opt-in) | mesh_peers, mesh_send, mesh_inbox, mesh_wait, mesh_state. Needs the grant's mesh scope and `slm remote keys allow KEY mesh` |
| Media (opt-in) | remember_media, get_media, remember_document, media_status, media_upload_link. Needs the grant's media scope and `slm remote keys allow KEY media`; saving also needs the write scope |
| Host only | The 45 tools classified as host-only: switching profile, maintenance, retention, decay, `forget`, the code graph, `slm_loop_run`, `mesh_lock`, `mesh_events`, `mesh_status`, `mesh_summary`, set_mode and the rest of that set. `expand` is not in it |

Web access is narrower than this table: an app connected through the dashboard reaches only the tools its approval named (recall, search, fetch and get_status always; save and session tools only if you ticked them), as set out in [Web Access and Connected Apps](Web-Access-and-Connected-Apps). On either path the daemon enforces the policy on every request. It accepts only the MCP methods `initialize`, `server/discover`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` and the standard client notifications, matches tool names exactly, refuses a body over 1 MiB, a repeated JSON key or a batch, answers `tools/list` with only the tools the key may call, and answers a refused call as an MCP tool error with the code `remote_tool_not_allowed`. A response is capped at 4 MiB. Company mode refuses `slm remote` keys. That is an enterprise deployment, or a workspace that requires sign-in; if the mode cannot be read, the keys are refused as well ([Security, Company Mode and Teams](Security-Company-Mode-and-Teams)).

## Notes on specific tools

`slm_loop_run` blocks while it polls its gate, up to `max_wallclock_s` (default 15 seconds, at most 120), and writes every lap to memory under the tag `loop:NAME`. Its gate needs both a recall of `gate_query` that returns a confident match and an independent execution receipt named by `gate_contract`; without a valid contract it cannot reach DONE. `require_support=true` also needs the [answer check](Answer-Check) to judge the memories sufficient. Setting `SLM_LOOP_KILL` to any non-empty value stops loops. See [Bounded Loops](Bounded-Loops).

The Optimize tools cache and compress only what you route through them. They do not intercept the main conversation turn without the proxy ([Optimize](Optimize)). Do not cache secrets, and treat a `ccr_id` like a capability.

`get_memory_summary` is extractive unless the profile runs a model, and the response carries `coverage` and `source_fact_ids` because session ids are sparse; a session summary is usually partial. For `community`, `target` is the `community_id` from a recall's `thematic_context`.

`recall`, `search` and `recall_trace` follow the [Retrieval Score Contract](Retrieval-Score-Contract): `relevance_score` is query relevance, `ranking_score` is diagnostic, and `memory_confidence` belongs to the stored assertion.

The optional `observe_bounded_loop_evidence` tool needs the separate `bounded-loops-mcp` executable. Receipts are observation-only and cannot change recall or ranking.

Code: `mcp/server.py` (registration and precedence), `mcp/profiles.py`, `mcp/profile_names.py`, `mcp/agent_context.py`, `mcp/resources.py`, `mcp/tools_core.py`, `mcp/tools_active.py`, `mcp/tools_brain.py`, `mcp/tools_code_graph.py`, `mcp/tools_mesh.py`, `mcp/tools_media.py`, `mcp/tools_optimize.py`, `mcp/tools_loops.py`, `server/remote_tool_policy.py`.
