# Refuse to publish internal process detail or private correspondence.
#
# This repository is public. Three separate things have leaked into it and been
# removed by hand after the fact: the owner's verbatim words about marketing
# positioning, the names and roles of the agents used to build it, and the name
# of the internal development method. None of that helps a reader of the code and
# all of it is expensive to un-publish, because git history keeps a copy.
#
# So the check runs before a push rather than after a discovery. It is
# deliberately narrow: it looks for the specific phrasings that leaked, not for
# every use of an ordinary word. Review annotations (CRIT, CRIT-1) and design-doc
# references (LLD §5) are NOT flagged — they read as normal engineering shorthand
# and sweeping them would be a large diff for no protection.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-no-internal-leaks.sh            # scan tracked files
#   scripts/check-no-internal-leaks.sh --staged   # scan what is about to commit
#
# Exit 0 clean, 1 if anything matched.

# "DeepSeek V3 (Free)" option in the settings UI, a certification test listing
# Cursor/Gemini/Grok/Muse as hosts. Flagging those trains the reader to ignore
# this script, which is worse than no script. What must not ship is a model
# named as one of the AGENTS THAT BUILT THIS, and that reads differently.

Nothing was pushed. Rewrite the flagged text to state the technical fact and
drop the framing — what the code does, not who asked for it or which stage of
which process produced it. The one permitted attribution is:
